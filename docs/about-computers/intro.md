# Why study computers?

Your job expects you to build mobile apps / frontends / own the full stack or whatever the business requirement could be. But the undelying common denominator across all the jobs in the modern days is to understand and work with computers at an advanced lesvel.

To work at an advanced level, we need to have a solid foundation at computers. We should be able to explain a five year old precisely how a computer works, be able to convince your boss about why a certain computer configuration is right fit for your job or make a PPT about a cluster configuration.

Whatever your goal is, understanding computers is indispensible.

Thats why I put together a few notes on topics around computers like storage, processing etc.

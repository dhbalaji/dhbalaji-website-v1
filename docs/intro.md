# BoK - Body of Knowledge

Bok (Body of Knowledge) refers to the core teachings and skills required to work in a particular field or industry. 

Many students in my country attempt, tough entrance exams for getting into college every year. These students have diverse family backgrounds, schools like private / government, access to extra tution classes, access to focussed study centers, etc. But its the `BoK` which acts like a compass for the students. By carefully mastering the topics mentioned in the `BoK` the students clear the college entrance exams.

The modern day version of `BoK` is the `Learning Paths` on several learning platforms like Udemy, PluralSight, etc. I totally admire them.

Inspired by `BoK` & `Learning Paths`, I have put together the a seperate section on my website which would list the core competencies to

- Build modern apps
- Get a job
- Conduct interview for job position
- Train the mentees & 
- Finally share knowledge in an open and useful manner.


> Its important to stay skillful than ever before because both the opportuninities & competition are global.

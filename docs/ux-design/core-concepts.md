# Principles of Design


Objects and environments should be designed to be usable without modification, by as many people as possible.

## Four characteristics of accessible design

1. Perceptibility - everyone should be able to perceive the design, regardless of sensory abilities.
2. Operability - everyone can use the design regardless of the physical abilities.
3. Simplicity - everyone can understand and use the design, regardless of experience.
4. Forgiveness - design minimize the occurrence and consequence of errors.

## Instructional strategies

- Advance Organizer - they present big picture
    - Expository - used when information is new to user
    - Comparative - used when user is familiar with similar model
- Chunking
- Inverted pyramid
- Storytelling

Example: Manual for industrial machinery

## Aesthetic Usability Effect

People perceive more aesthetic designs as easier to use than less-aesthetic designs. Aesthetic designs are more effective in fostering positive attitudes than unaesthetic designs.

Example: Mobile phones that look great. People complain less when they have great looking phones.

## Affordance

The object and the environment are better suited for some functions than others. When the affordance of the object and environment corresponds with its intended function, the design will perform more efficiently and will be easier to use.

Example: Push plate on a door for pushing door to open.

## Alignment

Elements in a design should be aligned with one or more other elements. This creates a sense of unity and cohesion.

example: Ballot system for voting. Candidates and punch holes are aligned.

## Archetypes

Common bias that human brains associate with a subject. For danger, we use spikes, snakes etc. For a brand to look positive and outside the society, Harley uses more black and loud engines.

## Attractiveness bias

A tendency to see attractive people as more intelligent, competent, moral and sociable than unattractive people. The attractiveness bias is a function of both biological and environmental factors.

## Baby face bias

A tendency to see people and things with baby faced features as more naive, helpless and honest than those with mature features.

## Chunking

A technique of combining many units of information into a limited number of units or chunks, so that the information is easier to process and remember.


## Closure

A tendency to preceive a set of individual elements as a single, recognizable pattern, rather than multiple, individual elements. Use closures to reduce the complexity and increase the interestingness of designs.

## Cognitive Dissonace

A tendency to seek consistency among attitudes, thoughts and beliefts. Congnitive dissonance is a state of mental discomfort that occurs when a persons attitudes, thoughts and beliefs conflict.

Opposite is called consonance and a state of comfort results.

The point of minimum justification represents the optimal level of incentive required to change behaviour and attitude.

## Color

Color is used in design to attract attention, group elements, indicate meaning, and enhance aesthetics. The common guidelines about the use of color

- Number of colors, limit to 5
- Color combinations by using analogous, complementary and other combinations.

## Common fate

Elements that are moving together with a same velocity or flicker are considered to be logically related. This is due to our perception.

## Comparison

A method of illustrating relationships and patterns in system behaviors by representing two or more system variables in a controlled way.


## Confirmation

A technique for preventing unintended actions by requiring verification of the actions before they are performed. Confirmations are used to prevent a class of errors called slips. Confirmations slow task performance and should be reserved for use with critical and irreversible operations.

## Consistency

The usability of a system is improved when similar parts are expressed in similar ways. There are 4 types of consistency, they are 

- Aesthetic
- Functional
- Internal
- External

## Constancy

The tendency to perceive objects as unchanging, despit changes in sensory input. For instance, perception that the radio volume is still very high when heard from a distance.

## Constraint

A method of limiting the actions that can be performed on the system. There are 2 types of constraints

- Physical constraints - limit the range of possible actions by redirecting physical motion in specific ways. The three kinds of physical constraints are paths, axes and barriers.

- Physcological constraints - limit the range of possible actions by leveraging the way people perceive and think of the world. Eg, symbols, conventions and mapping.

## Control

The level of control provided by a system should be related to the proficiency and experience levels of the people using the system. For example, menu option to save helps beginners but direct access to save via keyboard shortcut helps the advanced user.

## Convergence

A process in which similar characteristics evolve independently in multiple systems. For instance, in 4 wheelers, the steering, engine and tyres are the same in all the cars functionally. This gives the designers and innovators a chance to work on refining and improvising them consistently.

Stable environments with convergent system designs are receptive to minor innovations and refinements but resist radical departures from established designs.

Unstable environments with no convergent system designs are receptive to major innovations and experimentation, but offer little guidance as to which designs may or may not be successful.

## Cost benefits

An activity will be pursued only if its benefits are equal to or greater than the costs. From a design perspective, the cost benefit principle is typically used to access the financial return associated with new features and elements.

## Defensible Space

A defensible space that has territorial markers, opportunities for surveillance and clear indications of activity and ownership. The aim of defensible spaces is to deter crime.

## Depth of processing

A phenomenon of memory in which information that is analyzed deeply is better recalled than information that is analyzed superficially.

The more deeply learners process the information, the better they learn. Depth of processing is improved through the use of multiple presentation media and learning activities that engage learners in elaborative rehearsal.

## Development Cycle

Successful products typically follow four stages of creation: requirements, design, development and testing. All products progress sequentially through basic stages of creation.

- Requirements - gathered through market research, customer feedback, etc. Design requirements are derived from direct knowledge or experience
- Design - the stage where design requirements are translated into a form that yields a set of specifications. Excellent design is usually accompolished through careful research of existing or analogous solutions, ample use of prototyping and many iterations of trying.
- Development - the development stage is where design specifications are transformed into a actual product.
- Testing - The stage where the product is tested to ensure that it meets design requirement and specifications and will be accepted by target audience.

## Entry point

A point of physical or attentional entry into a design. People judge books by the cover, internet sites by their first pages and buildings by their lobbies. This initial impression of a system or environment greatly influences subsequent perceptions and attitudes which affect the quality of subsequent interactions.

- Minimal barriers - avoid tight parking spots, noisy entrances, sales people at the door.
- Points of prospect - should allow people to become oriented and clearly survey available options.
- Progressive lures - to attract and pull people through the entry point.

## Errors

An action or omission of action yielding an unintended result. Most accidents are caused by what is referred to as human error, yet most accidents are actually due to design errors rather than errors of human operation. There are 2 types of errors

- Slips - occur when an action is not what was intended. Slips are result of automatic, unconscious processes and frequently result from a change of routing or interruption of an action
- Mistakes are referred as errors of intention or planning and occur when an intention is inappropriate

## Expectation effect

A phenomenon in which perception and behavior changes as a result of personal expectations or the expectations of others

- Halo effect
- Hawthorne effect 
- Pygmalion effect
- Placebo effect
- Rosenthal effect
- Demand characteristics

## Exposure effect

Repeated exposure to stimuli for which people have neutral feelings will increase the likeability of the stimuli. For example, a song that gets repeated a lot.

## Face-ism Ratio

The ratio of face to body in an image that influences the way the person in the image is perceived. More faceism shows powerful personality, less face shows attractive or sensual side of the person

## Factor of safety

Design requires dealing with unknowns. The use of more elements than is thought to be necessary to offset the effects of unknown variables and prevent system failure. Use safety factors to minimize the probability of failure in a design.

## Feedback Loop

A relationship between variables in a system where the consequences of an event feedback into the system as input, modifying the event in the future. Every action creates an equal and opposite reaction. When reactions loop back  to affect themselves, a feedback loop is created.

Positive feedback amplifies output, resulting in growth. Negative feedback dampens output, stabilizing the system.

## Fibonacci sequence

A sequence of the numbers in which each number is the sum of the preceding two. The ubiquity of the sequence in nature has led many to conclude that patterns based on fibonacci sequence are intrinsically aesthetic and therefore worthy of consideration in design.

## Figure ground relationship

Elements are perceived as either figures or ground. Figure elements are objects of focus and ground elements are undifferentiated background.

## Fitts law

The time required to move to a target is a function of target size and distance to a target. Applicable for design related to pointing at a target.

## Five hat racks

There are 5 ways to organize information. They are category, time, location, alphabet and continuum.

Category - Electronics or items
Time - Chronological events
Location - Maps or routes
Alphabet - Reference material
Continuum - Organize by magnitude, low to high etc

## Flexibility usability tradeoff

As the flexibility of the system increases, the usability decreases. When audience have poor understanding of the needs, then use flexible designs to address the broadest possible set of future applications like swiss knife.

## Forgiveness

Designs should help people avoid errors and minimize the negative consequences of errors when they do occur. For example, having an undo button. A history pallette in photoshop.

## Form follows function

Beauty in design results from purity of function. The aesthetic considerations in design should be secondary to functional considerations.

## Framing

A technique that influences decision making and judgement by manipulating the way information is presented. Framing is the use of images, words and context to manipulate how people think about something.


## Garbage in- garbage out

The quality of system output is dependent on the quality of system input. The best way to avoid garbage out is to prevent garbage in.

## Golden ratio

A ratio within the elements of a form, such as height to width, approximating 0.618. The golden ratio is the ration between two segments such that the smaller segment is to the larger segment as the larger segment is to the sum of the two segments.

Geometries of a design should not be contrived to create golden ratios, but golden ratios should be explored when other aspects of the design are not compromised.

## Good continuation

Elements arranged in a straight line or a smooth curve are perceived as a group, and are interpreted as being more related than elements not on the line or curve. Good continuation is commonly used in comouflage. The lines on zebra continue across one another when in a herd, making it difficult for predators to target any one zebra.

## Gutenberg diagram

A diagram that describes the general pattern followed by the eyes when looking at evenly distributed, homogenous information.

A layout following the Gutenberg diagram would place key elements at the top left (Eg headline), middle (image) and bottom right (contact information). top right is a strong fallow area.

## Hick's Law

The time it takes to make a decision increases as the number of alternatives increases. All tasks consist of four steps:

1. Identify a problem or goal
2. Access the available options to solve the problem or achieve the goal
3. Decide on an option
4. Implement the option

## Hierarchy

Heirachical organization is the simplest structure for visualizing and understanding complexity. The methods include, trees, nests and stairs.


## Heirarchy of needs

In order for a design to be successful, it must meet people basic needs before it can attempt to satisfy heigher level needs. Good design follow the hierarchy of needs principle. The five key levels of needs in the hierarchy are described below.

- Functionality needs
- Reliability needs
- Usability needs
- Proficiency needs
- Creativity

## Highlighting

A technique for bringing attention to an area of text or image.If applied improperly, however highlighting can be ineffective and actually reduce performance in these areas.

Highlight no more than 10 percent of the visible design.

## Iconic Representation

The use of pictorial images to improve the recognition and recall of signs and controls. These are 4 types of iconic representation.

- Similar icons
- Example icons
- Symbolic icons
- Arbitary icons

## Immersion

A state of mental focus so intense that awareness of the real world is lost, generally resulting in a feeling of joy and satisfaction.

When preceptual and cognitive systems are under taxed, people become apathetic and bored. If they are over taxed, people become stressed and frustrated. Immersion occurs when perceptual and cognitive systems are challenged at near capacity without being exceeded.

## Interference Effects

A phenomenon in which mental processing is made slower and less accurate by competing mental processes. Interference effects occur when two or more perceptual or cognitive processes are in conflict. For example, instead of identifying the color of the text, our brain reads the word first.

## Inverted pyramid

A method of information presentation in which information is presented in descending order of importance.

## Iteration

A process of repeating a set of operations until a specific result is achieved. They are design iteration and development iteration.

## Law of Pragnanz

A tendency of interpret ambiguous images as simple and complete, versus complex and incomplete. It asserts that when people are presented with a set of ambiguous elements, they interpret the elements in the simplest way.

## Layering

The process of organizing information into related groupings in order to manage complexity and reinforce relationships in the information.

## Legibility

The visual clarity of text, generally based on the size, typeface and spacing of the characters used.

## Life cycle

All products progress sequentially through four stages of existence: 

- Introduction - official birth of a product
- Growth - challenging stage
- Maturity - peak of the product life cycle
- Decline - end of life cycle

## Mapping

A relationship between controls and their movements or effects. Good mapping between controls and their effects results in greater ease of use.

## Mental model

People understand and interact with systems and environments based on mental representations developed from experience.

## Mimicry

The act of copying properties of familiar objects, organisms or environments in order to realize specific benefits afforded by those properties.

- surface mimicry
- behavioral mimicry
- functional mimicry

## Mnemonic device

A method of reorganizing information to make information easier to remember.

## Modularity

A method of managing system complexity that involves dividing large systems into multiple smaller self contained systems

## Most average facial appearance effect

A tendency to prefer faces in which eyes, nose, lips and other features are close to the average of a population.

## Normal distribution

A term used to describe a set of data, that when plotted forms a symemetrical bell shapped curve.

## Ockhams Razor

Given a choice between functionally equivalent designs, the simplest design should be selected


## Operant conditioning

A technique used to modify behaviour by reinforcing desired behaviours and ignoring or punishing undesired behaviours


## Orientation sensitivity

A phenomenon of visual processing in which certain line orientations are more quickly and easily processed and discriminated than other line orientations.

## Performance load

The greater the effort to accomplish a task, the less likely the task will be accompolished successfully.

- Cognitive load
- Kinematic load

## Performance vs Preference

The designs tha help people perform optimally are often not the same as the designs that people find most desirable.

## Picture superiority effect

Pictures are remembered better than words

## Progressive disclosure

A strategy for managing information complexity in which only necessary or requested information is displayed at any given time.

## Prospect Refuge

A tendency to prefer environments with unobstructed views (prospect) and areas of concealment and retreat (refuge).

## Prototyping

The use of simplified and incomplete models of a design to explore ideas, elaborate requirements, refine specification and test functionality

## Proximity

Elements that are close together are perceived to be more related than elements that are farther apart.

## Readability

The degree to which prose can be understood, based on the complexity of words and sentences.

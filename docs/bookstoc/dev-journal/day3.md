# Day 3 of Bookstoc Product Development

Date: 18-Aug-2024

## Did

- Worked on set up bookstoc nextJS fullstack setup
- Upgraded packages and I understand package dependency resolutions

### Feedback

- There is a gap from day 2 to day 3, its my first feedback item. To stick to the plan.
- Previous day we ditched monorepo to clear the clutter. This day, we parked the idea of docker image as I envision the app to run from my home server and not from any cloud vendor.
- I am no full stack guy, I am forcefully fullstack because thats the route any nextJS dev has to take. I picked a few tech names from conferences and here is the list. Thanks copilot for taking me from 0 to 0.2 and I got stuck

Tech items

- UI

  - Chakra UI
  - Tailwind CSS
  - emotion
  - framer

- BE

  - Prisma
  - MongoDB
  - REST Api
  - NextJS

- Testing
  - Playwright testing

## Todo

- For the next few days, explore each of the tools listed above and get from 0.2 to 0.5

# Day 1 of Bookstoc Product Development

Date: 11-Aug-2024

## Did

1. Ideation of bookstoc
2. UX design of landing page
3. Thoughts on roadmap and plans for sustainable, profitable journey ahead

### Ideation

- To replace my broken/semi working excel sheet containing financial data with dynamic web app
- To include knowledge from financial books and make tools out of them
- Dev
    - Make reusable boilerplate/template which includes roles and preveilages for anyone to use
    - Make design choices to enable components to be highly reusable with/without login
    - Plans for security at all levels including 2 factor auth, db level encryption

### UX designs

- Referred to dribble designs
- Used my wacom digital pen to make some mockups on simple onenote draw, it was productive session instead of pen and paper
- Have made mockup for mobile devices and desktop devices separately

### Roadmap

- Deciding on what are the features that we need to scope for first launch, in my case I am my own client so here are my pressing needs, I would say `MVP 1`
    - Model stock portfolio builder & emulate with past and future
    - SIP logic into the portfolios
    - A functional tool to collect news related to the sectors, companies, macros etc
- Most of the above features do not need login which is what we need to build traction at earlier days
- The AI goodness and features including personal IP will be part of paid & closed source offering

## TODO

- Collect requirements for MVP 1
- Estimate the requirements
- Set deadline and do the refinement
- Make UI designs and other engineering items

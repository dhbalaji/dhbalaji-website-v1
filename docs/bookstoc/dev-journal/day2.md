# Day 2 of Bookstoc Product Development

Date: 12-Aug-2024

## Did

- Worked on set up bookstoc monorepo

### Feedback

- I am writing this post on day 3, now it feels like this step is a waste of time as it has no business relevance
- The monorepo setup needs more technical expertise compared to simple git
- To clarify, one of my business needs in the long term would be to partly open source dev and closed source dev. Monorepos at a beginner level do not have a great support to address this need

## Todo 

- Drop monorepo idea, go with folders and single repo

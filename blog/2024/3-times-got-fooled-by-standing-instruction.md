As a techie, managing digital spending has come with its own set of challenges, particularly when it comes to managing finances and subscriptions. One recurring issue that has cost me money on multiple occasions is the use of standing instructions for payments, where entering credit card details during free trials can lead to unforeseen financial consequences. In this blog post, I will share three instances where standing instructions resulted in financial loss and discuss strategies to mitigate these risks.

## Google Cloud: The Silent Bill Accumulator

> Same can happen on any cloud services aggregator

Google Cloud's free tier is a playground for developers, offering a range of services to experiment with. However, the requirement to enter credit card information exposes users to potential financial risks. Some dormant services can accumulate bills, and unpaid amounts accrue interest at a hefty 30% per annum. To avoid an unpleasant surprise, it is crucial for developers to actively monitor their Google Cloud billing section, even when services are in a dormant stage. While setting budgets can help control costs, it's imperative to note that alerts alone may not prevent services from running over the set limit.

## Netflix and Allies: The Subscription Renewal Trap

Managing media consumption subscriptions can be challenging, especially when juggling multiple platforms. To optimize costs, my family cycles through apps every two months to watch all available titles without paying for them simultaneously. The challenge lies in remembering to cancel subscriptions before they auto-renew. Forgetting to do so results in wasted money. Vigilance and regular subscription audits are essential to avoid unnecessary charges.

## Overcharging after Subscription Renewal

Yearly renewing subscriptions often come with an unwelcome surpriseâ€”the increased subscription price. Unfortunately, standing instructions automatically accept the higher cost, even if the renewed service may no longer be worth the investment. To prevent this, it's crucial to reassess the value of the service before allowing standing instructions to renew it automatically.

## How to Avoid Unwanted Charges

1. Maintain a Detailed Record: Create and regularly update an Excel sheet containing all websites where you've authorized standing instructions for payments. This centralized record will serve as a quick reference and aid in monitoring financial commitments.

2. Stay Informed: Actively monitor notifications and emails related to payments and billing. Ignoring these alerts can lead to unintended financial consequences. Stay informed to take timely action. In India we have sihub website where we can see all the autopay instructions in one place.

3. Seek Remedies: In case of discrepancies or unexpected charges, don't hesitate to seek help from customer support. Engage with the respective platforms to find a suitable remedy, which might include closing an account or modifying standing instructions.

## Conclusion

As a techie, navigating the world of standing instructions requires diligence and strategic planning. By learning from my experiences with Google Cloud, media subscriptions, and renewal surprises, you can implement proactive strategies to avoid financial losses. Maintain meticulous records, stay informed, and don't hesitate to seek help when needed. With these precautions, you can enjoy the benefits of standing instructions without falling victim to their potential pitfalls.

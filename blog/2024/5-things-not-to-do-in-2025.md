# 5 Things I’m Letting Go of in 2025: Building a **Not-To-Do** List  

As tech enthusiasts, we often talk about **to-do lists** to stay productive. But have you ever considered the power of a **not-to-do list**? It's about consciously identifying habits or activities that no longer serve your goals and removing them. Here's my not-to-do list for 2025, crafted with the intent to stay focused, efficient, and aligned with my evolving priorities.

## 1. No More Public GitHub Repos  

Open-source contribution has been a cornerstone of the tech world, and I’ve had my share of excitement from it. But with the rise of AI tools, the landscape is changing. Unless you’re a core maintainer of a prominent library, the recognition that once came from showcasing code has diminished.  

In 2025, I’ll shift my energy toward **building meaningful products and functionalities** rather than maintaining a public code showcase. The focus will be on solving problems and creating impact—where the real value lies.

## 2. No Social Media Overload  

Social media can be a double-edged sword. It’s a goldmine for networking, but it’s also a time sink designed for immersion and doomscrolling. With AI tools providing quick insights (even without sitting through a 40-minute video), my reliance on these platforms will be minimal.  

Here’s my plan: **Engage with social media just once a week for an hour**, in the following order:  

1. **Facebook** for personal updates.  
2. **LinkedIn** for professional networking.  
3. **GitHub Feed** to track industry trends.  
4. **Twitter/X** for niche topics and hot takes.  
5. **YouTube Subscriptions** for targeted learning.  

Additionally, I’ll curate a list of websites to stay updated instead of depending on algorithm-driven feeds.  

## 3. No Two Visits Per Week To Office

Working from the office puts you into a routine which is a supporting stick for those who lack self discipline of waking up early, switching subjects under work naturally. Thats why I am against working from office on select days of the week.

## 4. No More Reading Goals  

I used to pride myself on being a voracious reader, devouring two books a week. But life evolves, and so do habits. For two consecutive years, I failed to hit my reading goals—and that’s okay.  

In 2025, I’ll stop setting rigid reading goals. Instead, I’ll use mobile apps that provide **daily book summaries** to stay updated with the latest titles. Physical books will still have a place in my collection, but the pressure to meet arbitrary goals will be a thing of the past.

## 5. No More Video Courses Unless I’ve Tried and Failed  

Video courses are everywhere—just one click away. But they often require hours of commitment, and many simply repackage information available in documentation or books.  

Moving forward, I’ll treat video courses as a **last resort**. I’ll prioritize **reading documentation**, **experimenting**, and leveraging AI for quick answers. If I still hit roadblocks, only then will I invest time in a course. The same logic applies to interviews or tutorials—AI can summarize key insights faster than a 60-minute watch.

## The Overall Theme: Build, Ship, and Upskill  

2025 is about **action over abstraction**. Instead of endlessly documenting best practices or creating small libraries, I’ll focus on:  

- **Building real applications** for my portfolio.  
- **Leveraging AI for 5x upskilling**.  
- Prioritizing **actual product development** over pre/post-work content.  

It’s time to let go of distractions and double down on meaningful work. Here’s to a focused and fulfilling year ahead!

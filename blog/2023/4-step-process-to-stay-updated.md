## 2. Embrace Conferences and Meetups

Frontend conferences and meetups are a treasure trove of insights.

- Accessibility standards are set by WCAG.
- TypeScript enthusiasts should monitor TypeScript proposals.

Becoming adept at deciphering these proposals can qualify you as a tech speaker and provide instant insights for your fellow developers.

## 4. Explore Case Studies, Job boards and Journals

Periodically, top-tier tech companies, such as Slack and Airbnb, release quality blogs that provide invaluable insights. Studying such content, which is tried and tested at scale on millions of users, can lead to innovative breakthroughs in your work. Notable publications, like Thoughtworks' Radar, delve into a wide array of frontend topics discussed at a CTO level, making them a must-read resource for any serious developer.

There is no easy way, the above said methods are not the easiest like skimming a newsletter or tech blog but I believe you can ascend to the ranks of an expert frontend developer with the above 4 strategies.

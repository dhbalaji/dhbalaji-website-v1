Self-taught, boot camp graduates, mentored individuals, accomplished interns, and dedicated professionals are among the terms that can be used to describe the new additions to our workforce. While these individuals possess exceptional coding skills, it's important to recognize that being the best programmer at work requires more than just technical expertise. To make a comprehensive and valuable contribution to our organization, it is essential to cultivate the following skills

1. Plan
2. Review
3. Collaborate
4. Professional Behaviour

## Plan

In the realm of corporate life, it is interesting to note that even individuals who have been laid off often had an extensive list of tasks and a backlog awaiting their attention. This fact serves to highlight the substantial workload that exists within most teams. As new joiners enter the organization, it becomes crucial for them to actively and purposefully select their assignments. This involves:

a. Choosing challenging tasks that push their abilities.
b. Prioritizing important assignments that contribute to unblocking the team's progress.
c. Pick tasks that match your strengths

These responsibilities should be undertaken in addition to fulfilling routine sprint commitments.

## Review

The role of a coder goes beyond the completion of a "git push". It extends to reviewing, providing feedback, and improving upon the work done by the team. Many codebases contain sections that have been written by past team members and have remained untouched for years. When reviewing such code, new joiners can engage in knowledge sharing and take the initiative to enhance areas that may be less familiar to others. This not only contributes to the overall improvement of the codebase but also helps foster a collaborative environment.

## Collaborate

In most teams, the contributions of lone developers tend to go unnoticed. To thrive in such environments, individuals with exceptional communication skills are highly valued. Developers with great communication skills have the ability to bring meetings to life, effectively facilitate virtual discussions, and ensure efficient meeting management. It's important to understand that meetings are a constant part of corporate life, occurring not only at the team level but also across departments, multiple teams, and even at the organizational level. Young developers should be mindful of basic meeting etiquette, such as joining on time, actively contributing valuable insights, and infusing a sense of enjoyment into the meetings.

To develop public speaking and built friends at work, I recommend tech workshops, tech meetings and forums like Toastmasters.


## Professional Behaviour

In the world of engineering, it is common for young engineers to gravitate towards their intern groups and form friendships with individuals who are at a similar comfort level and experience level. However, when it comes to young joiners in a professional setting, different expectations apply. Rather than sticking to their comfort zone, young joiners are encouraged to actively engage with senior engineers and learn from them through close collaboration.

Developing good manners and displaying a professional demeanor can significantly contribute to professional growth and garner attention within the industry. Simple gestures like a firm handshake, a warm smile, and a positive attitude can make a lasting impression and help establish credibility and respect among peers and superiors. These professional attributes not only create a favorable impression but also foster positive relationships and open doors to valuable opportunities for career advancement.

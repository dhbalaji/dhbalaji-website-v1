Here is the story behind functional custom email address `balaji@dhbalaji.dev`

## Why custom email domains

The custom email addresses look more professional on the resume or back of the truck, hope you got my point. I have seen all sort of weird email addresses on the resume like `sureshnaidu1929@gmail.com` but the improved version would be `contact@suresh.dev`

> Most developers have a website, why not a custom working email address

## Steps to create a functional custom email address

- Create a custom email on your domains registar which in my case is Google Domains

- Setup email forwarding

- Create an alias in your gmail

- Set app password

- Use gmail smtp settings, gmail address and app password to login

- Confirm the alias addition to gmail

- Voila, we are done.

- Extra steps, like custom signature for the domain could be added


## Next steps

Before we go any further, let me clarify two things. 
1. I am not going to pen down every step in this process, instead I will share valuable blog posts which [I referred and grateful for](https://alexlenail.medium.com/i-want-to-send-emails-from-my-google-domains-email-through-gmail-992bb3eae4c9)

2. This is a technical one. 
    
    a. Set up email forwarding by following [Google documentation](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/3251241?hl=en).
    
    b. You will not create a new gmail inbox but add an alias to the gmail. The gmail UI will show 
    a select dropdown with newly added custom domain
    
    c. Read the [Google Documentation](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22370?hl=en)

> Do most resumes come off the MS Word assembly line?

As an interviewer, I have seen a wide variety of resumes, from one-page to eight-page tomes. Very few resumes are well-written and impressive, while others are just lengthy documentation. Some resumes are difficult to read while others have information hidden inside paragraphs of text.

However, the best resumes are those that are visually appealing infographics which are easy to glance and understandable by the interviewer in under 10 seconds. Remember, less is more when you try to make an impression through words and copywriting.

If you are serious about marketing yourself, I encourage you to invest time in creating a catchy infographic resume. This type of resume can be a great way to stand out from the competition and show potential employers that you are creative and innovative.

I recently created a few infographic resumes, and I was even awarded by Canva for my iterative design work on my resume which happened because of my unsettling design spirit. If you would like some help creating your own infographic resume, I would be happy to assist you.

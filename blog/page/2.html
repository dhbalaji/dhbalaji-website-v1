<p>In the army, the personnel are called soldiers. In tech companies, the personnel are called resources. The army trains in camps and carries weapons. Resources work in offices, GCC, and carry laptops. In 2020 due to covid pandemic outbreak, the resources were asked to work from home. Thats how the resources experienced work from home lifestyle, the episode started. Fast forward 2024, the resources are asked to leave behind the work from home and come back to office marking the end of episode work from home, lovingly called the WFH.</p>
<p>Some companies went the extra mile and allowed the resources to work from anywhere forever. In a similar time frame, I wrote an article about <a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/WFH-vs-Remote-working#what-is-the-difference-between-wfh-and-remote-working" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work from home vs remote working</a>. The key takeaway was that working from home was a temporary fix unless the company adopted the culture mentioned in the book <a href="https://readingraphics.com/book-summary-remote-office-not-required/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote, Office Not Required</a>.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the start of 2024, almost all companies have given a first call, second call, or in some cases, a final call asking resources to get back to working from the office. This means that the comfort of working from home and the associated lifestyle is no more. But there have to be a few reasons why the back-to-office movement is happening. Of course, there are many reasons; here are a few as quoted by management.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="reasons-to-get-back-to-the-office">Reasons to get back to the office<a href="#reasons-to-get-back-to-the-office" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reasons to get back to the office" title="Direct link to Reasons to get back to the office">​</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Covid is out of the picture; we can get back to the old way of working from the office. Our senior management is already doing it.</li>
<li>Operating in silos or as small teams won&#x27;t boost the morale of the team or the culture of the company.</li>
<li>Use the office as a space to build your personal brand.</li>
<li>Please come to the office and use the building; we have purchased or leased it already for the long term. We have made it better in the recent renovation.</li>

<li>The company-wide call announcing mandatory work from the office for a minimum of 3 days.</li>
<li>Check if employees have punched into the office for a minimum of 3 days or 50% of working days.</li>
<li>Bring in a policy that allows reduced pay for people working remotely.</li>
<li>Bring in another policy that values presence in the office. No promotion if not working from the office. Personally, this statement is dangerous. Companies pay higher salaries to retain employees and not out of obligation. Having said that, more salary reduction could mean being on the layoff list.</li>

<li>In late 2020, after analyzing the implementation of WFH, it was clear that this was a temporary arrangement.</li>
<li>I condemn the press statements and town hall speeches by the management of tech companies in favor of working from anywhere. Everyone believed that working from home would continue forever.</li>
<li>Later in 2023, the management was the first to step into the office, followed by their immediate teams. This set an example for the whole company that working from the office is the way to conduct business.</li>
<li>Working from the office could mean perks like team lunches and client visits happening soon. Good for those with passports ready.</li>
<li>Companies need to be mindful about the transition and set the deadlines accordingly. Some employees were working in their pyjamas for long hours at home. In the work-from-office arrangement, they will waste time commuting, etc.</li>
<li>I am surprised when no management person said that working from the office is an opportunity for osmosis of ideas, easy to mentor juniors, or have fun moments. It looks like none of these happen at the workplace anymore or have been forgotten because of insufficient use.</li>

<p>One person got into an argument where he refused to take the laptop home in the work-from-office arrangement, which led to tensions at the workplace. Accept that no system is perfect and software has bugs. In a long career span of 40 years, anything can happen. Many trends come and go.</p>

<p>In the vast landscape of job opportunities in the Indian subcontinent, the niche role of design technologists remains as elusive as the majestic tigers that roam the region. Job postings for design technologists are a rarity, and it&#x27;s not every day that one comes across such an opportunity. Recently, I stumbled upon a job posting from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3812056674/?alternateChannel=search&amp;refId=Dz%2BIExfUI9357n%2BKI2VWsA%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=lY7zJQJjL%2Bd6EeIWSGrk8Q%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Bangalore for the position of Design Technologist</a>.

<p>The role of a design technologist lacks a universally accepted definition in the job market, prompting the Amazon recruiter to articulate their interpretation. As a Design Technologist at Amazon, one is expected to strike a balance between technical execution and design strategy, contributing to the creation of innovative landing pages and digital ad solutions. The ideal candidate possesses a passion for both design and development, demonstrating strong front-end proficiency, creative problem-solving skills, and a discerning eye for world-class functional design.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TLDR: Design and Technical Leadership = Design Technologist</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="my-observation">My Observation<a href="#my-observation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to My Observation" title="Direct link to My Observation">​</a></h2>
<p>The job requirements clearly emphasize mastery in frontend development, design, and UI with a focus on animations. An ideal candidate may have undergone a career transition from UX to Frontend or vice versa at some point. This role may not align with the skill set of full-stack engineers.</p>
<p>Rigorous preparation is paramount for applicants aiming to stand out in a competitive landscape. The scarcity of job openings necessitates a 10x effort in interview preparation, with priority often given to candidates from top colleges, those with resumes from reputed companies, and those with referrals. Design technologist roles demand intensive preparation, as exemplified by the specifics outlined in the discussed Amazon job posting.</p>

<p>As a techie, managing digital spending has come with its own set of challenges, particularly when it comes to managing finances and subscriptions. One recurring issue that has cost me money on multiple occasions is the use of standing instructions for payments, where entering credit card details during free trials can lead to unforeseen financial consequences. In this blog post, I will share three instances where standing instructions resulted in financial loss and discuss strategies to mitigate these risks.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="google-cloud-the-silent-bill-accumulator">Google Cloud: The Silent Bill Accumulator<a href="#google-cloud-the-silent-bill-accumulator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Google Cloud: The Silent Bill Accumulator" title="Direct link to Google Cloud: The Silent Bill Accumulator">​</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Same can happen on any cloud services aggregator</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google Cloud&#x27;s free tier is a playground for developers, offering a range of services to experiment with. However, the requirement to enter credit card information exposes users to potential financial risks. Some dormant services can accumulate bills, and unpaid amounts accrue interest at a hefty 30% per annum. To avoid an unpleasant surprise, it is crucial for developers to actively monitor their Google Cloud billing section, even when services are in a dormant stage. While setting budgets can help control costs, it&#x27;s imperative to note that alerts alone may not prevent services from running over the set limit.</p>

<p>Managing media consumption subscriptions can be challenging, especially when juggling multiple platforms. To optimize costs, my family cycles through apps every two months to watch all available titles without paying for them simultaneously. The challenge lies in remembering to cancel subscriptions before they auto-renew. Forgetting to do so results in wasted money. Vigilance and regular subscription audits are essential to avoid unnecessary charges.</p>

<p>Yearly renewing subscriptions often come with an unwelcome surprise—the increased subscription price. Unfortunately, standing instructions automatically accept the higher cost, even if the renewed service may no longer be worth the investment. To prevent this, it&#x27;s crucial to reassess the value of the service before allowing standing instructions to renew it automatically.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Maintain a Detailed Record: Create and regularly update an Excel sheet containing all websites where you&#x27;ve authorized standing instructions for payments. This centralized record will serve as a quick reference and aid in monitoring financial commitments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stay Informed: Actively monitor notifications and emails related to payments and billing. Ignoring these alerts can lead to unintended financial consequences. Stay informed to take timely action. In India we have sihub website where we can see all the autopay instructions in one place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seek Remedies: In case of discrepancies or unexpected charges, don&#x27;t hesitate to seek help from customer support. Engage with the respective platforms to find a suitable remedy, which might include closing an account or modifying standing instructions.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>As a techie, navigating the world of standing instructions requires diligence and strategic planning. By learning from my experiences with Google Cloud, media subscriptions, and renewal surprises, you can implement proactive strategies to avoid financial losses. Maintain meticulous records, stay informed, and don&#x27;t hesitate to seek help when needed. With these precautions, you can enjoy the benefits of standing instructions without falling victim to their potential pitfalls.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_Cdj3 padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_msZK"><a class="tag_PFQT tagRegular_Q3lL" href="/blog/tags/online-payments">online-payments</a></li><li class="tag_msZK"><a class="tag_PFQT tagRegular_Q3lL" href="/blog/tags/subscriptions">subscriptions</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_ggY7"><a href="/blog/2024/starting-ISR-activities-on-blog">Introducing Developer Social Responsibility (DSR), A New Avenue for Impactful Blogging</a></h2><div class="container_PR47 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-01-08T06:30:30.000Z">January 8, 2024</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_G1Zk"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_pG1a" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4" alt="D Balaji"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_ipb6"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_bfXO">D Balaji</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_JKrf" title="Lead Design Technologist">Lead Design Technologist</small><div class="authorSocials_E3AP"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown">

<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of technical blogs, where discussions often revolve around technology trends, career advice, and personal life hacks, there emerges a new wave of content – one rooted in societal impact. Enter DSR, or Developer Social Responsibility, a concept akin to the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) undertaken by companies.</p>
<p>Traditionally, major corporations like Tata Consultancy Services (TCSL) allocate a portion of their resources towards community-centric initiatives through CSR. In a similar vein, I, as a developer, am embarking on a novel journey – utilizing my platform to craft posts that serve the local community or residents of my locality. The underlying ethos of DSR is to provide valuable information that may not be readily available in the public domain, thereby bridging knowledge gaps and fostering a sense of community support.</p>
<p>Understanding the Principles of DSR Posts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Conciseness is Key:</strong>
DSR posts will embody brevity without compromising on substance. By distilling information into concise and digestible content, the aim is to deliver maximum value in a minimal timeframe. This ensures that readers can easily assimilate the information and apply it to their lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Positive Tone:</strong>
DSR posts will steer clear of a complaining or negative tone. The objective is to inspire and uplift, offering solutions and insights that empower readers rather than dwelling on issues. This positive approach not only resonates better with the audience but also aligns with the constructive spirit of social responsibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limited Social Media Promotion:</strong>
Unlike conventional blog posts that often rely heavily on social media channels for promotion, DSR posts will take a different route. By abstaining from aggressive promotion on platforms, the focus remains on organic reach and genuine engagement. This approach ensures that the content reaches those genuinely interested in community-centric information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In adopting the DSR framework, the intention is clear: to create content that transcends the digital realm and makes a tangible impact on the lives of individuals within the community. This initiative seeks to foster a sense of responsibility among developers, urging them to leverage their skills and knowledge for the betterment of society.</p>
<p>As the DSR journey unfolds, the commitment to concise, positive, and community-centric content remains steadfast. By embracing this unique approach, developers can play an active role in shaping a more informed, empowered, and connected society, one blog post at a time.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_Cdj3 padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_msZK"><a class="tag_PFQT tagRegular_Q3lL" href="/blog/tags/blogging">blogging</a></li><li class="tag_msZK"><a class="tag_PFQT tagRegular_Q3lL" href="/blog/tags/dsr-post">DSR-post</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_ggY7"><a href="/blog/2024/10-things-principal-frontend-job-boards-W1">Insights from Senior Frontend Engineers Job Descriptions - Week 1, 2024</a></h2><div class="container_PR47 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-01-03T13:30:30.000Z">January 3, 2024</time> · <!-- -->5 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_G1Zk"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_pG1a" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4" alt="D Balaji"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_ipb6"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_bfXO">D Balaji</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_JKrf" title="Lead Design Technologist">Lead Design Technologist</small><div class="authorSocials_E3AP"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown">

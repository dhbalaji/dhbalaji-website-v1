<p>Self-taught individuals, boot camp graduates, mentored professionals, accomplished interns, and dedicated experts are some of the remarkable talents that have joined our workforce. While their technical skills are exceptional, it&#x27;s important to recognize that becoming the best programmer at work entails more than just technical expertise. To make a comprehensive and valuable contribution to our organization, it is crucial to cultivate the following skills:</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="plan">Plan<a href="#plan" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Plan" title="Direct link to Plan">​</a></h2>
<p>In the corporate world, even individuals who have been laid off often had a significant workload and a backlog of tasks. This highlights the substantial volume of work within most teams. As new joiners, it is essential to actively and purposefully select assignments that challenge your abilities and contribute to unblocking the team&#x27;s progress. Additionally, identifying tasks that align with your strengths can further enhance your impact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let your peers know your strength through your work that you do.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="review">Review<a href="#review" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Review" title="Direct link to Review">​</a></h2>
<p>Being a coder goes beyond the act of pushing code to a repository. It involves reviewing, providing feedback, and improving upon the work done by the team. Many codebases contain sections that have remained untouched for years. By reviewing such code, new joiners can engage in knowledge sharing and take the initiative to improve areas that may be unfamiliar to others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Being proficient in reading and understanding others&#x27; code can accelerate your career growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="collaborate">Collaborate<a href="#collaborate" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Collaborate" title="Direct link to Collaborate">​</a></h2>
<p>The contributions of individual developers often go unnoticed in most teams. Exceptional communication skills are highly valued in such environments. Developers who can effectively communicate, lead engaging meetings, facilitate discussions, and manage virtual interactions are highly sought-after. Remember that meetings are an integral part of corporate life at various levels. Adhering to basic meeting etiquette, actively contributing valuable insights, and making meetings enjoyable can make a significant impact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keeping mum and over talking on the job are dangerous.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="professional-behavior">Professional Behavior<a href="#professional-behavior" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Professional Behavior" title="Direct link to Professional Behavior">​</a></h2>
<p>It is common for young engineers to form friendships within their intern groups, typically with individuals of similar experience levels. However, as young joiners in a professional setting, different expectations apply. Actively engaging with senior engineers and learning from their expertise through close collaboration is essential. Displaying good manners, maintaining a professional demeanor, and exhibiting positive attitudes contribute to professional growth and attract attention within the industry. Simple gestures like a firm handshake, a warm smile, and a proactive attitude establish credibility, respect, and foster positive relationships.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Youre being watched by your peers, behave diligently even when out of office.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A well-rounded professional understands the needs of the team and actively seeks opportunities to contribute rather than being solely focused on individual goals. By honing these skills, you will not only excel in your role but also establish yourself as a valuable asset within our organization.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_Cdj3 padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_msZK"><a class="tag_PFQT tagRegular_Q3lL" href="/blog/tags/work">work</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_ggY7"><a href="/blog/2023/experience-going-through-right-sizing-season">Right-Sizing, Five Things You Need to Know</a></h2><div class="container_PR47 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-05-24T15:30:22.000Z">May 24, 2023</time> · <!-- -->8 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_G1Zk"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_pG1a" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4" alt="D Balaji"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_ipb6"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_bfXO">D Balaji</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_JKrf" title="Lead Design Technologist">Lead Design Technologist</small><div class="authorSocials_E3AP"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Here is a short memoir about the right sizing function happening at all major organizations in 2023.</p>

<p>Warren Buffett is a renowned investor who has made a fortune by investing in undervalued companies. He is also known for
his wit and humor. One of his most famous quotes is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Only when the tide goes out do you discover who&#x27;s been swimming naked.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote, which was originally intended for investors, is also applicable to corporate employees. Not long ago, we
experienced a period of rapid hiring, with employees receiving multiple offers and corporations going on a hiring spree.
During this time, employees were able to negotiate favorable terms, such as high salaries, compensation packages, and
positions. However, economic cycles are real, and eventually, companies become overstaffed and their financial results
suffer. As a result, companies begin to lay off employees.</p>
<p>The quote &quot;Only when the tide goes out do you discover who&#x27;s been swimming naked&quot; is a reminder that economic conditions
can change quickly, and that companies need to be prepared for downturns. When the economy is strong, it is easy to get
caught up in the excitement and make decisions that are not sustainable in the long run. However, when the economy
turns, companies that have been overextended will be the ones that suffer the most. The employees at these companies
will suffer the most.</p>

<p>2023 is the year of right-sizing companies, and it is having a significant impact on Indians working in multinational
corporations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The media and press have been reporting on layoffs, and this has created a sense of anxiety and uncertainty among
employees. When a common person meets a techie, they often inquire about their job security. The abbreviation &quot;CFBR&quot; is
also becoming increasingly common on LinkedIn. This stands for &quot;Commenting For Better Reach,&quot; and it refers to the
practice of commenting on posts from people who are looking for work.</p>
<p>There are a number of factors that are contributing to the right-sizing of companies. These include the global economic
slowdown, the rise of automation, and the increasing competition from emerging markets. As a result of these factors,
many companies are finding it necessary to reduce their workforces.</p>
<p>The right-sizing of companies is having a significant impact on Indians working in multinational corporations. Many
employees have been laid off, and those who remain are facing increased pressure to perform. The job market is also
becoming more competitive, as more and more people are looking for work.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="observations">Observations<a href="#observations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Observations" title="Direct link to Observations">​</a></h2>
<p>Here are your observations about right sizing and how to mitigate risk, in a more professional tone:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="there-is-no-good-news">There is no good news<a href="#there-is-no-good-news" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to There is no good news" title="Direct link to There is no good news">​</a></h3>
<p>Right-sizing, or downsizing is the process of reducing the size of a company&#x27;s workforce. This can be done through
layoffs, attrition, or a combination of the two. Right-sizing can be a difficult decision for companies, but it is often
necessary in order to remain competitive.</p>
<p>There is no good news for employees who are affected by right-sizing. The job market is already competitive, and
right-sizing can make it even more difficult to find a new job. In addition, right-sizing can have a negative impact on
the morale and productivity of the employees who still remain with the organizations.</p>
<p>Most companies are not actively hiring during this economic downturn.</p>

<p>Right-sizing can lead to an increase in demand for education and training. Employees who are laid off may need to
upskill or re-skill in order to find new jobs. However, the education sector may not be able to keep up with the dynamic
market nature.</p>
<p>In addition, employers may be reluctant to hire employees who have only recently completed education or training. They
may prefer to hire employees who have deeper experience in the field.</p>

<p>Right-sizing can be a very stressful experience for employees. It can lead to feelings of uncertainty, anxiety, and
fear. In addition, employees may start to doubt their own abilities. They may worry that they will not be able to find a
new job, or that they will not be able to find a job that is as good as their old one.</p>
<p>Generative AI and other new technologies can also add to the stress of right-sizing. These technologies can make it
easier for companies to replace employees with machines. This can lead to feelings of insecurity and obsolescence.</p>

<p>Right-sizing can have a negative impact on morale at work. Employees who are laid off may feel betrayed and resentful.
In addition, employees who remain may be worried about their own job security. This can lead to a decrease in
productivity and an increase in turnover. Both physical and mental health will suffer.</p>

<p>There is no surefire way to avoid being laid off. However, there are some things that employees can do to increase their
chances of surviving right-sizing.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Join a profitable company. Employees are more likely to be laid off from companies that are struggling financially.
Therefore, it is important to join a company that is profitable and has a good reputation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that your work has a business value. Employees who do work that is essential to the company&#x27;s operations are
less likely to be laid off. Therefore, it is important to make sure that your work is valuable to the company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Become a valuable asset to the company. Employees who are valuable assets to the company are less likely to be laid
off. This means being able to do more than one thing, being able to work independently, and being able to think
outside the box.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be positive and proactive. Employees who are positive and proactive are more likely to be seen as valuable assets to
the company. They are also more likely to be able to find new jobs if they are laid off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a financial cushion. Employees who have a financial cushion are less likely to be stressed out if they are laid
off. This means having enough money saved up to cover your expenses for at least six months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embrace rightsizing as part of career and plan accordingly. Avoid spending on lifestyle inflation like a fancy car,
flat, etc. Instead, spend time on marketing yourself like personal website, network, etc. Employees have a shelf life
like any other commodity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="other-myths">Other myths<a href="#other-myths" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Other myths" title="Direct link to Other myths">​</a></h2>
<p>Sure, here are some myths related to right sizing in tech companies, along with some clarifications:</p>
<p><strong>Myth 1</strong>: Young and low-level engineers are exempted during right sizing.</p>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: Everyone is examined through a different lens, regardless of experience level or position. In some cases,
young
and low-level engineers may be more likely to be laid off, as they may be seen as less essential to the company&#x27;s
operations. However, this is not always the case, and there are many factors that companies consider when making layoff
decisions. No department is safe during right sizing including human resources and accounting.</p>
<p><strong>Myth 2</strong>: Seniors and managerial staff are most hit during right sizing.</p>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: While managerial staff layoffs and top level exits are widely discussed. In fact, in some cases, companies may
choose to retain managerial staff in order to maintain continuity and leadership during a time of change.</p>
<p><strong>Myth 3</strong>: Contractors will be let go first.</p>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: Contractors will be impacted, but they are not always let go first during right sizing. In some cases,
companies may choose to retain
contractors in order to finish the ongoing projects. Once the work is done, their contracts may not be extended.</p>
<p><strong>Myth 4</strong>: Companies cut all the extra costs before considering right sizing employees.</p>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: While companies may try to cut costs in other areas before laying off employees, this is not always possible.
The fancy pantry, expensive office buildings will still operate with some modifications.
In
some cases, the only way for a company to remain profitable is to lay off employees.</p>
<p><strong>Myth 5</strong>: Jobs cut in high-cost centers are moved to low-cost centers.</p>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: This is not necessarily true. While companies may sometimes move jobs to lower-cost centers, this is not
always
possible or feasible. In some cases, the only way for a company to remain profitable is to lay off employees in all
locations.</p>
<p>It is important to note that these are just some of the myths related to right sizing in tech companies. The specific
factors that companies consider when making layoff decisions will vary from company to company.</p>

<p>To sum up, right-sizing can be a very stressful experience for employees. It can feel like a runtime exception at work,
where everything is suddenly thrown into chaos. However, by following the tips above, employees can increase their
chances of surviving right-sizing and finding a new job.</p>
<p>Only during right sizing activities we realize the value of money and time.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_Cdj3 padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_msZK"><a class="tag_PFQT tagRegular_Q3lL" href="/blog/tags/work">work</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_ggY7"><a href="/blog/custom-email-address">How I created functional custom google domains email address &quot;balaji@dhbalaji.dev&quot;</a></h2><div class="container_PR47 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-05-14T18:30:22.000Z">May 14, 2023</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_G1Zk"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_pG1a" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4" alt="D Balaji"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_ipb6"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_bfXO">D Balaji</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_JKrf" title="Lead Design Technologist">Lead Design Technologist</small><div class="authorSocials_E3AP"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Here is the story behind functional custom email address <code>balaji@dhbalaji.dev</code></p>

<p>As an interviewer, I have seen a wide variety of resumes, from one-page to eight-page tomes. Very few resumes are well-written and impressive, while others are just lengthy documentation. Some resumes are difficult to read while others have information hidden inside paragraphs of text.</p>
<p>However, the best resumes are those that are visually appealing infographics which are easy to glance and understandable by the interviewer in under 10 seconds. Remember, less is more when you try to make an impression through words and copywriting.</p>
<p>If you are serious about marketing yourself, I encourage you to invest time in creating a catchy infographic resume. This type of resume can be a great way to stand out from the competition and show potential employers that you are creative and innovative.</p>
<p>I recently created a few infographic resumes, and I was even awarded by Canva for my iterative design work on my resume which happened because of my unsettling design spirit. If you would like some help creating your own infographic resume, I would be happy to assist you.</p>

<p>Post covid, I do not attend in person meetings. Hey Covid, you added bunch of excuses to the list. I do not use Groww app however I decided to attend this meeting to hear the financial jargon.

<p>Let us assume you are an informed investor. You would select a sector, then industry, and then the stock. But have you compared the stock pick with the peers thoroughly? I do not do that because I know only about company X and not its peers.</p>
<p>The simplest way to compare would be to use screener website peers table or make your own table with key KPI and access the peers closely. We might pick a better stock in this approach.</p>

<p>The average SIP tenure is about 3 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have seen the fancy Groww SIP calculator throwing 8 figures when you input a decent SIP number and 15 years of tenure but how many really get to realize the numbers? Not many of us, because markets are volatile, scary and nerve wrecking when the corpus gets bigger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In short term the market generates losses but in a period of 10+ years the chances of market investment making losses is very low.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An average investor tends to take the money out of MF or stop the SIP process. This is preventing people from becoming crorepati.</p>
<p>The assumption is that you invest your money into flexi cap fund or some evergreen funds which are professionally managed. Mutual funds can be compared to market performance. If the MF is consistently underperformed for multiple years in a row in spite of markets going upwards, then you may have to switch the MF.</p>

<p>High P/E stocks essentially means that in case of crash, it would take longer time to recover from the crash.</p>

<p>The speaker did not say mutual fund sahi hai at all. The speaker was an advocate of tagging an investment to a goal. Tagging investment to a goal relieves the investor from emotional conundrums like should I take my money out or should I worry about the crash, etc.</p>
<p>Let us say you are saving for child college, then the ripe time to think of withdrawing money would be 3 years before college. Withdrawal can be done in SWP.</p>

<p>When you work with modern and legacy codebases, we have to switch the node versions that fits the project.</p>
<p>Most developers are familiar with <code>nvm</code> aka Node version manager.</p>
<p>While we switch to a codebase which uses a different codebase, use <code>nvm use</code> command. But its not a magical command to analyze the node version requirements.</p>
<p>Make sure to add <code>.nvmrc</code> to the project root with the minimal node version.</p>

<p>AI tools have entered into our life like a bicycle for a kid. We have to learn to use the bicycle else there wont be much fun. Identifying professional use cases for AI without compromising data security and privacy is a challenge like the kid ensuring not to fall from cycle before his friends while learning to drive it.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_Cdj3 padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_msZK"><a class="tag_PFQT tagRegular_Q3lL" href="/blog/tags/work">work</a></li><li class="tag_msZK"><a class="tag_PFQT tagRegular_Q3lL" href="/blog/tags/tech-solved-it">tech-solved-it</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_ggY7"><a href="/blog/updating-yourself-with-feedly">Staying updated with feedly free version</a></h2><div class="container_PR47 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-02-17T15:30:22.000Z">February 17, 2023</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_G1Zk"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_pG1a" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4" alt="D Balaji"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_ipb6"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_bfXO">D Balaji</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_JKrf" title="Lead Design Technologist">Lead Design Technologist</small><div class="authorSocials_E3AP"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Feedly app" src="/assets/images/feedly-1dda09f4b0100a82aa3967949043ba2a.png" width="1748" height="870" class="img_GjaX"></p>
<p>We have reached a time in history where one newspaper does not fit all. One music app does not fit all, one form of text communication does not fit all. The same holds good with our efforts to keep ourself updated.</p>

<p>Feedly has been in the market since a long time. Feedly excels at keeping up with sources emitting their updates over RSS feed. Lets say you visit 5 different web sites or news sites every day. Instead of consuming content on their website, we can achieve from one interface inside feedly.</p>
<p>Feedly free version leaves you behind when it comes with keeping up with other information streams like twitter but I feel its a good trade off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With a setup like feedly, you are isolated from ads and promoted content that deter your focus</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before I proceed further, I would like to confess that I had setup feedly before many years and it failed. One of the main reason was that I overloaded the feed with multiple channels. This time I want to keep it simple.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>7 categories of feeds for each day of the week starting with financial news on Sunday</p>

<p>Here are my categories</p>

<p>If you want quality content, then we need to find quality sources of content. I followed the trusted, reputed and relevant sources only.</p>
<p>Avoid repetition of content which reduces the number of news items to view.</p>

<p>On a side note, I am taking refugee from all things social media till Aug 15 this year. I have installed a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site/lebiggkccaodkkmjeimmbogdedcpnmfb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chrome extension</a> to block all websites that distract us.</p>

<p>Old school method of consuming content with RSS feeds might look so old school but thats one way to avoid click baits, trackers, etc. Lets get focussed and acheieve the goal to keep yourself updated at things you care about.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_Cdj3 padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_msZK"><a class="tag_PFQT tagRegular_Q3lL" href="/blog/tags/tech-solved-it">tech-solved-it</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/blog/page/3"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Newer entries</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/blog/page/5"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Technical</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/portfolio">Portfolio</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/certifications/marketing/GA4">Certifications</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/Notes/accessibility/notes">Notes</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Non Technical</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/my-reads">Reads</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Contact me</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="mailto:balaji@dhbalaji.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Email<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_SFRX"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhbalaji/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Linkedin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_SFRX"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.github.com/dhbalaji/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Github<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_SFRX"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2025 dhbalaji.dev</div></div></div></footer></div>

<p>In a world inundated with financial advice, it&#x27;s surprising that many young professionals, especially the techies, still find themselves struggling financially. As someone who has risen from financial difficulties, I feel compelled to share my insights in what might be my last blog post on personal finance. This one&#x27;s dedicated to my fellow bachelor employee countrymen who are navigating the complexities of finances without a strategy. Remember you need money from even before you are born and after you are dead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TLDR: This article is my last blog article about financial planning for bachelor techies in India.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understanding the Types:</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve observed that bachelor techies can be broadly classified into two types:</p>
<p><strong>Type 1:</strong> No Debt</p>
<p><strong>Type 2:</strong> Have Debt</p>
<p>Let us assume your salary is 100 INR in your bank account, how to allocate salary of 100 INR? Now, let&#x27;s delve into the nitty-gritty of an ideal financial plan based on your type.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Depending on your salary, you may adjust the percentage split but ensure you have plan to send money into each category.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="type-1-no-debt">Type 1: No Debt<a href="#type-1-no-debt" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Type 1: No Debt" title="Direct link to Type 1: No Debt">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>For those fortunate enough to have no outstanding commitments, allocating your salary wisely is relatively simple:</p>
<p>First Batch - Investment</p>
<ol>
<li>15Rs: Retirement Savings</li>
<li>15Rs: Stocks/Business</li>
<li>15Rs: Short-Term Savings</li>
</ol>
<p>Second Batch - Expenses</p>
<ol>
<li>20Rs: Rent/HRA</li>
<li>20Rs: General Expenses</li>
</ol>
<p>Third Batch - Others</p>
<ol>
<li>5Rs: Discretionary</li>
<li>5Rs: Parents/Cultural Expenses</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="type-2-have-debt">Type 2: Have Debt<a href="#type-2-have-debt" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Type 2: Have Debt" title="Direct link to Type 2: Have Debt">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>If you find yourself burdened with loans, a strategic approach is necessary:</p>
<p>Priority Batch - Debt Servicing</p>
<ol>
<li>25Rs: EMI</li>
<li>10Rs: Principal Repayment</li>
</ol>
<p>First Batch - Investment</p>
<ol>
<li>5Rs: Retirement Savings</li>
<li>5Rs: Stocks/Business</li>
<li>10Rs: Short-Term Savings</li>
</ol>
<p>Second Batch - Expenses</p>
<ol>
<li>20Rs: Rent/HRA</li>
<li>20Rs: General Expenses</li>
</ol>
<p>Third Batch - Others</p>
<ol>
<li>5Rs: Parents/Cultural Expenses</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways<a href="#key-takeaways" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Key Takeaways" title="Direct link to Key Takeaways">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Two critical points emerge from these allocations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Survival Mode: Until your loans are fully serviced, you&#x27;re essentially in survival mode. This phase might be tough, but it&#x27;s essential to secure a healthy financial future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Future Planning: Without a strategic approach, you might compromise your financial stability in the long run.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="other-tips">Other Tips<a href="#other-tips" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Other Tips" title="Direct link to Other Tips">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Apart from allocating your salary smartly, consider these practical tips to bolster your financial health:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Debt Refinancing: Explore options to reduce interest rates on existing loans. If possible, avoid debt leverage to raise wealth or buy consumables.</p>
</li>

<p>In the pursuit of YouTube success, many content creators find themselves on a quest for the perfect gadgets to enhance their production quality. I too embarked on this journey, investing in four gadgets with the hope of elevating my content. However, hindsight has brought clarity, revealing that these purchases did not contribute significantly to my YouTube success. In this blog post, I&#x27;ll delve into each gadget and share the lessons learned.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="1-whiteboard-and-marker-pens-simplicity-vs-practicality">1. Whiteboard and Marker Pens: Simplicity vs. Practicality<a href="#1-whiteboard-and-marker-pens-simplicity-vs-practicality" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Whiteboard and Marker Pens: Simplicity vs. Practicality" title="Direct link to 1. Whiteboard and Marker Pens: Simplicity vs. Practicality">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>At first glance, a whiteboard and marker pens seemed like a practical investment to recreate a classroom setting for content demonstrations. However, I soon realized that this setup required a level of confidence and was better suited for academic content. For my YouTube endeavors, originality, presentation, uniqueness, and searchability took precedence over the traditional classroom approach.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="2-digital-pens-the-unanticipated-learning-curve">2. Digital Pens: The Unanticipated Learning Curve<a href="#2-digital-pens-the-unanticipated-learning-curve" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Digital Pens: The Unanticipated Learning Curve" title="Direct link to 2. Digital Pens: The Unanticipated Learning Curve">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Digital pens promised seamless scribbling and emphasis during screen sharing. Unfortunately, the reality included a steep learning curve. The basic digital pen I initially purchased turned out to be of little use without acquiring the specific skills needed. This experience underscored the importance of thoroughly researching and understanding the tools before making a purchase.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="3-software-for-editing-a-windows-update-and-more">3. Software for Editing: A Windows Update and More<a href="#3-software-for-editing-a-windows-update-and-more" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3.

<p>Video editing is an indispensable aspect of content creation, and I invested time in updating my Windows and learning the nuances of video editing. While I achieved some success, the hardware limitations of my PC hindered the production of high-quality, full-HD videos. This realization highlighted the need for a balance between software proficiency and hardware capabilities to meet the standards of modern YouTube content.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="4-lavalier-microphone-battling-ambient-noise">4. Lavalier Microphone: Battling Ambient Noise<a href="#4-lavalier-microphone-battling-ambient-noise" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4.

<p>Capturing pristine audio in a less-than-ideal environment posed a significant challenge. Despite the assistance of a lavalier microphone, the ambient noise from barking dogs and honking drivers persisted, preventing the attainment of studio-quality audio. This experience emphasized the importance of considering the external factors that can impact audio quality and exploring alternative solutions.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="conclusion-a-pragmatic-approach-to-youtube-success">Conclusion: A Pragmatic Approach to YouTube Success<a href="#conclusion-a-pragmatic-approach-to-youtube-success" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion: A Pragmatic Approach to YouTube Success" title="Direct link to Conclusion: A Pragmatic Approach to YouTube Success">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>In conclusion, achieving YouTube success requires a blend of skills, awareness, and time commitmentâ€”factors that I found myself lacking. While certain gadgets, like a camera stand and a reliable camera phone, proved to be useful, the shift towards shorts and reels emerged as a more practical strategy. Testing content with shorter formats allows creators to gauge audience response without the need for an expensive infrastructure required for full-length videos.</p>
<p>Aspiring YouTubers should prioritize understanding their niche, refining their content, and gradually investing in tools that align with their evolving needs. Rather than hastily diving into full-length videos, a strategic focus on shorts and reels can provide valuable insights and pave the way for a more sustainable path to YouTube success.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>In the dynamic world of content creation, platforms like YouTube have played a pivotal role in connecting creators with their audiences. As someone who embarked on a YouTube journey in 2020, I experienced the highs and lows of content creation. However, after three years of dedication, I found myself at a crossroads, leading me to make the tough decision to step away from the platform. In this post, I&#x27;ll delve into the three primary reasons that prompted me to bid farewell to YouTube and explore an alternative path that aligns better with my goals.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="reason-1-landscape-has-changed">Reason 1: Landscape has changed<a href="#reason-1-landscape-has-changed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reason 1: Landscape has changed" title="Direct link to Reason 1: Landscape has changed">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic saw a surge in content creation as people sought new ways to spend their time. The demand for content was high, but by 2023, the landscape had transformed significantly. Educational content creators faced a daunting challenge of standing out amidst the crowd pullers like news, comics, and film-related content. Unfortunately, educational content struggled to capture the audience&#x27;s attention, making it increasingly challenging for solo creators to thrive.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="reason-2-posted-content-does-not-get-promoted">Reason 2: Posted content does not get promoted<a href="#reason-2-posted-content-does-not-get-promoted" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reason 2: Posted content does not get promoted" title="Direct link to Reason 2: Posted content does not get promoted">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>While YouTube serves as a vast platform with immense potential, getting content noticed became an uphill battle. The algorithmic changes and sheer volume of content meant that creators had to rely on their existing subscriber base or invest in promotional efforts. For those starting from scratch, breaking through the noise proved to be as challenging as finding a needle in a haystack. The lack of organic promotion made it difficult for new creators without a substantial audience to showcase their work.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="reason-3-form-over-content">Reason 3: Form over content<a href="#reason-3-form-over-content" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reason 3: Form over content" title="Direct link to Reason 3: Form over content">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>The evolution of content creation standards brought forth new challenges. The days when a front camera sufficed for creating engaging content are long gone. Today, success demands high-quality cameras, aesthetically pleasing backgrounds, captivating thumbnail graphics, and more. The time-consuming process of adhering to these visual standards often took away from the core focus â€“ the content itself. This shift towards a more polished presentation, while visually appealing, did not necessarily translate into increased viewership.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="alternative">Alternative<a href="#alternative" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Alternative" title="Direct link to Alternative">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>In light of these challenges, I&#x27;ve decided to retreat from YouTube content creation and refocus my efforts on traditional blogging. Leveraging the power of AI tools, my blogging endeavors have seen a resurgence. The efficiency and effectiveness of these tools have allowed me to rediscover the joy of content creation without the constraints and challenges posed by the ever-evolving landscape of YouTube.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="conclusion">Conclusion:<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion:" title="Direct link to Conclusion:">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>The decision to step away from YouTube was not made lightly, and it&#x27;s essential for content creators to regularly reassess their chosen platforms. While YouTube remains a giant in the industry, the shifting landscape and challenges faced by solo creators necessitate adaptability. For those seeking a more flexible and personally fulfilling creative outlet, exploring alternative mediums, like traditional blogging with AI enhancements, might prove to be the key to sustained success and satisfaction.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_Cdj3 padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_msZK"><a class="tag_PFQT tagRegular_Q3lL" href="/blog/tags/content">content</a></li><li class="tag_msZK"><a class="tag_PFQT tagRegular_Q3lL" href="/blog/tags/youtube">youtube</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_ggY7"><a href="/blog/2023/4-step-process-to-stay-updated">Keeping Updated at Frontend Tech, 4 Strategies Beyond Blogs and Podcasts</a></h2><div class="container_PR47 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-10-18T15:30:22.000Z">October 18, 2023</time> Â· <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_G1Zk"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_pG1a" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4" alt="D Balaji"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_ipb6"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_bfXO">D Balaji</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_JKrf" title="Lead Design Technologist">Lead Design Technologist</small><div class="authorSocials_E3AP"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/confused-boy-d9d070205429f6f9c3c8af0fdcc04f6a.webp" width="1280" height="720" class="img_GjaX"></p>

Today, as I mark my fifth work anniversary with my fourth employer, I am overwhelmed with the euphoria of this accomplishment. Throughout my career, I have experienced various moments of significance, and in this blog, I wish to share four events that have shaped my journey.</p>

<p>As fate would have it, the most promising opportunities often arise when one is least expecting them. Such was the case when I attended the GIDS conference in 2018. Among the myriad of stalls, Sabre&#x27;s presence caught my attention. Completing intriguing challenges and applying for hiring opportunities, I secured some delightful takeaways from the event. Little did I know that my enthusiasm would lead to a profound connection with the hiring manager, ultimately leading to my employment at Sabre.</p>

<p>Having honed my skills in frontend development, joining Sabre introduced me to an entirely new world of full stack development expertise. The experience proved to be both exhilarating and challenging, as I was entrusted with responsibilities beyond the frontend realm. Despite the initial stress, my foundational knowledge in Java enabled me to navigate through unfamiliar territories with confidence and adaptability.</p>

<p>In the dynamic world of software development, greenfield projects often garner excitement, but the complexities of brownfield issues are seldom met with the same enthusiasm. Overcoming these challenges requires not only technical expertise but also strategic proposals to secure the necessary resources. Adapting to the agile development approach, I learned the significance of addressing outdated software libraries and the importance of proactive solutions.</p>

<p>Throughout my five years, I remained unbound to a single project, exploring different avenues within the organization. This willingness to embrace new opportunities led to a pivotal moment in my career when I received a promotion to lead engineer. Embracing a role within the Enterprise Design Language team, I was immersed in the world of frontend development, which I found to be exhilarating. The experience reinforced the significance of internal job postings, fostering growth and organizational exploration.</p>

With gratitude for the past and excitement for the future, I eagerly await the challenges and triumphs that await in the next chapter of my career.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_Cdj3 padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_msZK"><a class="tag_PFQT tagRegular_Q3lL" href="/blog/tags/work">work</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_ggY7"><a href="/blog/2023/4-things-to-know-about-hosur-book-fair">4 things you need to know about The Enthralling Annual Book Fair in Hosur, A Haven for Literature Enthusiasts</a></h2><div class="container_PR47 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-07-23T15:30:22.000Z">July 23, 2023</time> Â· <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_G1Zk"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_pG1a" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4" alt="D Balaji"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_ipb6"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_bfXO">D Balaji</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_JKrf" title="Lead Design Technologist">Lead Design Technologist</small><div class="authorSocials_E3AP"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="&amp;quot;Balaji at Hosur Book Festival&amp;quot;" src="/assets/images/at-hosur-book-festival-39c0dfa3ef2bbf132d65bed874bd24ec.webp" width="1600" height="900" class="img_GjaX"></p>
<p>As an ardent book enthusiast residing in an emerging city, I have often faced the challenge of finding a well-stocked bookstore or literary hub in the vicinity. However, to invigorate our minds and hearts, the residents of Hosur organize an annual book fair that has become a highly anticipated event on our cultural calendar. Having attended this remarkable fair since 2017, I present here four essential aspects that encapsulate its significance.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="a-celebration-of-tamil-literature">A Celebration of Tamil Literature<a href="#a-celebration-of-tamil-literature" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Celebration of Tamil Literature" title="Direct link to A Celebration of Tamil Literature">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Happening in the heart of Tamil Nadu, the Hosur Book Fair predominantly showcases an impressive collection of books within the realm of Tamil literature. From timeless classics such as Thirukural to masterpieces like Ponniyan Selvan, the fair offers an array of literary treasures that cater to the diverse tastes of the Tamil-speaking populace. A dedicated book store with books related to Periyar, how about that.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="diverse-religious-book-stalls">Diverse Religious Book Stalls<a href="#diverse-religious-book-stalls" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Diverse Religious Book Stalls" title="Direct link to Diverse Religious Book Stalls">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>A distinctive feature of the book fair is the presence of stalls dedicated to various religious themes and spiritual pursuits. Visitors can explore bookshelves teeming with Islamic texts, works by Isha Foundation, and other publications centered around religious ideologies. Importantly, these stalls respect the individual choices of visitors, making the experience inclusive and welcoming.</p>

<p>A true delight for bibliophiles, the fair boasts a fascinating array of used book stalls akin to an adventurous treasure hunt. Many of these stalls offer books previously owned by readers or libraries outside India. The books are sold either by weight or individually at a nominal price of Rs 100 per piece, providing exceptional value for those seeking hidden literary treasures.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="the-trustworthy-source-authentic-books-from-distributors">The Trustworthy Source: Authentic Books from Distributors<a href="#the-trustworthy-source-authentic-books-from-distributors" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Trustworthy Source: Authentic Books from Distributors" title="Direct link to The Trustworthy Source: Authentic Books from Distributors">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>In a world rife with counterfeit copies, the book fair stands out as a reliable platform where customers can acquire authentic books directly from esteemed distributors, publishers, and reputable book houses. Unlike some online platforms that occasionally deal in pirated editions, the fair assures visitors of genuine and legally sourced literature. While the prices might marginally exceed those found on certain online retailers, patrons are more than willing to invest in the assurance of authenticity.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>The annual Hosur Book Fair has evolved into a remarkable celebration of literature and culture, enchanting the bookworms of the city and beyond. With its emphasis on Tamil literature, diverse religious offerings, captivating used book stalls, and a commitment to genuine publications, this literary extravaganza has etched a special place in the hearts of the attendees. As a devoted visitor, I eagerly look forward to each edition of the fair, for it not only rejuvenates the mind but also fosters a profound appreciation for the world of written words.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_Cdj3 padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_msZK"><a class="tag_PFQT tagRegular_Q3lL" href="/blog/tags/books">books</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_ggY7"><a href="/blog/2023/4-pillars-of-financial-success">4 Pillars of Financial Success for Individuals in India</a></h2><div class="container_PR47 margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-06-20T15:30:22.000Z">June 20, 2023</time> Â· <!-- -->5 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_G1Zk"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_pG1a" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3672491?v=4" alt="D Balaji"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_ipb6"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/dhbalaji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_bfXO">D Balaji</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_JKrf" title="Lead Design Technologist">Lead Design Technologist</small><div class="authorSocials_E3AP"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/money-matters-25a14c6e8e8d16eda2faf7cbd2e4ba75.webp" width="1280" height="853" class="img_GjaX"></p>
<p>In the pursuit of financial success, individuals often dedicate a significant amount of time to consuming financial news, financial literature, minimalist techniques or simply ask their friends for ideas. In this article, we will focus on four essential pillars of financial success for individuals with an Indian background. By following these principles, individuals can strive towards a more secure and prosperous financial future.</p>
<p>By focusing on steady income growth, reducing liabilities, avoiding major losses, and holding long-term growth assets, individuals can enhance their financial well-being and build a solid foundation for the future.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="steady-growing-income">Steady growing income<a href="#steady-growing-income" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Steady growing income" title="Direct link to Steady growing income">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Establishing a steady growing income is a fundamental principle for individuals in India who aspire to achieve financial success. In a country where many middle-class individuals experience limited job growth and security, relying on a single source of income can be precarious. Personally they have to rack up atleast one year worth of expenses in a liquid fund or fixed deposit which I categorize as lazy funds.</p>
<p>Its surprising to see senior advocates, doctors, businessmen making handsome income in their late 80s but a retired engineer making nothing other than his pension if any.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip #1: Choosing a retirement proof career is key in financial planning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are already mid way through career, start and grow a promising business because business owner cannot be fired or forced to retire by labour laws.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="declining-or-reduced-liabilities">Declining or reduced liabilities<a href="#declining-or-reduced-liabilities" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Declining or reduced liabilities" title="Direct link to Declining or reduced liabilities">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Traditionally, individuals in India would secure employment within their local communities and often live with extended family or in joint households. Consequently, recurring expenses such as rent, electricity, and locking up money in the form of advances or security deposits were relatively unheard of. However, the modern lifestyle has led to an alarming increase in imprudent accumulation of liabilities. Even before securing employment, individuals often find themselves burdened with education loans, followed by payday loans soon after receiving their first salary. While it is not fair to blame individuals entirely, the expenses associated with metropolitan living necessitate managing multiple financial responsibilities with a limited income, leaving minimal room for savings in their 40s.</p>
<p>Maintaining strong family connections, prioritizing children&#x27;s needs, and preserving cultural traditions can quickly deplete financial resources, making one&#x27;s 30s more challenging than anticipated. Ultimately, achieving financial success requires generating income several times greater than one&#x27;s liabilities. If it proves difficult to substantially increase income, it is imperative to focus on reducing costs and minimizing liabilities. Many successful individuals have chosen to retain modest lifestyles, refraining from upgrading furniture, driving smaller vehicles, and using the same vehicle for extended periods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip #2: Avoid the shiny, fad and impractical expenses. Think long term before you commit for something.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="not-incurring-major-losses">Not incurring major losses<a href="#not-incurring-major-losses" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Not incurring major losses" title="Direct link to Not incurring major losses">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>It is an undeniable fact that the path to wealth creation has always been filled with risks and uncertainties. A notable story from the book &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot; recounts an individual who lost their investments due to misguided advice when purchasing gold, resulting in poor decision-making. Today, individuals continue to face similar challenges, often influenced by biased recommendations from stockbrokers, mis-selling insurance agents, and other vested interests. Countless individuals have taken leaps of faith only to discover that their ventures led to significant financial losses, whether through failed businesses or ill-informed investment decisions. Such losses can have long-term consequences on one&#x27;s financial stability and progress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip #3: In new ventures, Diversify even if the returns are less because losing capital means losing the game of financial success.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="create--holding-long-term-growth-assets">Create &amp; Holding long term growth assets<a href="#create--holding-long-term-growth-assets" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Create &amp; Holding long term growth assets" title="Direct link to Create &amp; Holding long term growth assets">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Anecdotally, we often encounter stories of individuals who achieved substantial wealth by merely leading ordinary lives and retaining inherited ancestral properties. While inheriting wealth is undoubtedly advantageous, those without such fortune must exchange their money for the creation, growth, and retention of assets.</p>
<p>It is essential to recognize that assets need not be limited to gold, stocks, or land. Owning a thriving tea stall in a strategic location that was once neglected but is now a prime spot exemplifies a valuable asset. Many successful family businesses in India trace their roots back to the entrepreneurial efforts of grandparents who fearlessly embarked on ventures that yielded fruitful returns.</p>
<p>Rather than advocating for excessively frugal lifestyles or sacrificing vacations to save money, it is more advantageous to focus on creating assets that can generate significant returns over the long term.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip #4: Put time in creating assets instead of trying to save rupees in short term</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>The road to financial success is not easy especially when you have a family which includes dependents, a society who pushes new fads like spending 2 lakhs on child first birthday, a govt which introduces taxes on whatever you do and use, a job where growth is like a slow moving train, etc. But good use of money can make you comfortable financially. Its okay to be comfortable than be miserable in terms of money.</p>
<p>Achieving financial success in India requires a combination of discipline, informed decision-making, and a long-term perspective. By prioritizing a steady growing income, reducing liabilities, avoiding major losses, and focusing on long-term growth assets, individuals can enhance their financial well-being and increase their chances of achieving their financial goals.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_Cdj3 padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_msZK"><a class="tag_PFQT tagRegular_Q3lL" href="/blog/tags/finance">finance</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/blog/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Newer entries</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/blog/page/4"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Technical</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/portfolio">Portfolio</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/certifications/marketing/GA4">Certifications</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/Notes/accessibility/notes">Notes</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Non Technical</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/my-reads">Reads</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Contact me</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="mailto:balaji@dhbalaji.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Email<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_SFRX"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhbalaji/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Linkedin<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_SFRX"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.github.com/dhbalaji/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Github<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_SFRX"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2025 dhbalaji.dev</div></div></div></footer></div>

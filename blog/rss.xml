            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As tech enthusiasts, we often talk about <strong>to-do lists</strong> to stay productive. But have you ever considered the power of a <strong>not-to-do list</strong>? It's about consciously identifying habits or activities that no longer serve your goals and removing them. Here's my not-to-do list for 2025, crafted with the intent to stay focused, efficient, and aligned with my evolving priorities.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="1-no-more-public-github-repos">1. No More Public GitHub Repos<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/5-things-not-to-do-in-2025#1-no-more-public-github-repos" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. No More Public GitHub Repos" title="Direct link to 1. No More Public GitHub Repos">​</a></h2>
<p>Open-source contribution has been a cornerstone of the tech world, and I’ve had my share of excitement from it. But with the rise of AI tools, the landscape is changing. Unless you’re a core maintainer of a prominent library, the recognition that once came from showcasing code has diminished.</p>
<p>In 2025, I’ll shift my energy toward <strong>building meaningful products and functionalities</strong> rather than maintaining a public code showcase. The focus will be on solving problems and creating impact—where the real value lies.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="2-no-social-media-overload">2. No Social Media Overload<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/5-things-not-to-do-in-2025#2-no-social-media-overload" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. No Social Media Overload" title="Direct link to 2. No Social Media Overload">​</a></h2>
<p>Social media can be a double-edged sword. It’s a goldmine for networking, but it’s also a time sink designed for immersion and doomscrolling. With AI tools providing quick insights (even without sitting through a 40-minute video), my reliance on these platforms will be minimal.</p>
<p>Here’s my plan: <strong>Engage with social media just once a week for an hour</strong>, in the following order:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Facebook</strong> for personal updates.</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn</strong> for professional networking.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Feed</strong> to track industry trends.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter/X</strong> for niche topics and hot takes.</li>
<li><strong>YouTube Subscriptions</strong> for targeted learning.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, I’ll curate a list of websites to stay updated instead of depending on algorithm-driven feeds.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="3-no-two-visits-per-week-to-office">3. No Two Visits Per Week To Office<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/5-things-not-to-do-in-2025#3-no-two-visits-per-week-to-office" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. No Two Visits Per Week To Office" title="Direct link to 3. No Two Visits Per Week To Office">​</a></h2>
<p>Working from the office puts you into a routine which is a supporting stick for those who lack self discipline of waking up early, switching subjects under work naturally. Thats why I am against working from office on select days of the week.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="4-no-more-reading-goals">4. No More Reading Goals<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/5-things-not-to-do-in-2025#4-no-more-reading-goals" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4. No More Reading Goals" title="Direct link to 4. No More Reading Goals">​</a></h2>
<p>I used to pride myself on being a voracious reader, devouring two books a week. But life evolves, and so do habits. For two consecutive years, I failed to hit my reading goals—and that’s okay.</p>
<p>In 2025, I’ll stop setting rigid reading goals. Instead, I’ll use mobile apps that provide <strong>daily book summaries</strong> to stay updated with the latest titles. Physical books will still have a place in my collection, but the pressure to meet arbitrary goals will be a thing of the past.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="5-no-more-video-courses-unless-ive-tried-and-failed">5. No More Video Courses Unless I’ve Tried and Failed<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/5-things-not-to-do-in-2025#5-no-more-video-courses-unless-ive-tried-and-failed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5. No More Video Courses Unless I’ve Tried and Failed" title="Direct link to 5. No More Video Courses Unless I’ve Tried and Failed">​</a></h2>
<p>Video courses are everywhere—just one click away. But they often require hours of commitment, and many simply repackage information available in documentation or books.</p>
<p>Moving forward, I’ll treat video courses as a <strong>last resort</strong>. I’ll prioritize <strong>reading documentation</strong>, <strong>experimenting</strong>, and leveraging AI for quick answers. If I still hit roadblocks, only then will I invest time in a course. The same logic applies to interviews or tutorials—AI can summarize key insights faster than a 60-minute watch.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="the-overall-theme-build-ship-and-upskill">The Overall Theme: Build, Ship, and Upskill<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/5-things-not-to-do-in-2025#the-overall-theme-build-ship-and-upskill" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Overall Theme: Build, Ship, and Upskill" title="Direct link to The Overall Theme: Build, Ship, and Upskill">​</a></h2>
<p>2025 is about <strong>action over abstraction</strong>. Instead of endlessly documenting best practices or creating small libraries, I’ll focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Building real applications</strong> for my portfolio.</li>
<li><strong>Leveraging AI for 5x upskilling</strong>.</li>
<li>Prioritizing <strong>actual product development</strong> over pre/post-work content.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s time to let go of distractions and double down on meaningful work. Here’s to a focused and fulfilling year ahead!</p>
<p>What’s on your <strong>not-to-do list</strong> for 2025? Share in the comments—I’d love to hear your thoughts!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>YouTube has become an indispensable part of our daily lives. From entertainment to education, it’s a treasure trove of information waiting to be tapped. However, like any tool, its impact depends on how we use it. By channeling our time on YouTube towards productive endeavors, we can unlock immense value. Here are three transformative lessons I’ve learned from YouTube in 2024, which have reshaped my perspective and enriched my life.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="1-diy-laptop-and-motorcycle-repairs-empower-yourself">1. DIY Laptop and Motorcycle Repairs: Empower Yourself<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/things-learnt-from-youtube-2024#1-diy-laptop-and-motorcycle-repairs-empower-yourself" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. DIY Laptop and Motorcycle Repairs: Empower Yourself" title="Direct link to 1. DIY Laptop and Motorcycle Repairs: Empower Yourself">​</a></h2>
<p>Nothing is more frustrating than being technically inclined yet unable to handle minor repairs. For many, minor fixes—whether it’s a laptop issue or a motorcycle—are often overlooked by mechanics or seen as unworthy of their time. Insurance companies don’t cover such small mishaps, and for the owner, they’re just time-wasters. But learning to perform these tasks yourself is a game-changer.</p>
<p>Through YouTube, I’ve gained the confidence to tackle these challenges. DIY repair videos have become my go-to resource before making any major purchases. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most business-grade laptops have detailed repair tutorials available.</li>
<li>Popular vehicles, like Maruti cars, also have a wealth of content explaining common issues and fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This newfound skill has transformed how I make purchase decisions. DIY repairability is now a core factor in my selection framework. The ability to fix things with my own hands not only saves money but also fosters a sense of independence and ownership.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Before buying any big or expensive item, check if it is DIY repair-friendly. It can save you a lot of hassle down the line.</p>

Financial Frameworks for Life: Learn from Real Stories" title="Direct link to 2. Financial Frameworks for Life: Learn from Real Stories">​</a></h2>
<p>Conversations around finance often revolve around trades, insurance, or IPOs, but rarely delve into overarching financial frameworks or strategies for building wealth. Thanks to YouTube, we can now access diverse perspectives and stories from people at different stages of their financial journey.</p>
<p>Just today, I watched two fascinating videos:</p>
<ol>
<li>A story about a betting addict burdened by debt—a cautionary tale of financial mismanagement.</li>
<li>The inspiring journey of a top-level executive who retired early to live sustainably on a farm. Their financial strategy included years of disciplined saving and investments, supplemented by income from startups. Here’s their asset allocation:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>40% in real estate, including their farm.</li>
<li>40% in equities and mutual funds.</li>
<li>10% in gold.</li>
<li>10% in liquid funds for emergencies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These narratives offer invaluable insights and practical frameworks for managing personal finances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Before you quit your job, ensure you have a solid financial runway. Asset allocation is crucial for long-term stability.</p>

Tech Events Live: Stay Ahead of the Curve" title="Direct link to 3. Tech Events Live: Stay Ahead of the Curve">​</a></h2>
<p>For developers and tech enthusiasts, attending global conferences like Next.js Conf or Google I/O often seems like a distant dream. Enter YouTube, the ultimate equalizer. With live streams and recorded sessions, anyone, anywhere, can stay updated on the latest trends and technologies.</p>
<p>This year, I tuned into multiple tech events that would have been impossible to attend in person. These events not only kept me informed but also inspired me to stay ahead in my career. The ability to access these resources at your convenience is a game-changer for lifelong learning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Actionable Insight:</strong> Don’t miss out on tech trends—attend virtual events and conferences through YouTube.</p>

<p>YouTube is undoubtedly a powerful platform for learning and growth. However, navigating it effectively requires discipline. The abundance of content can quickly lead to doom-scrolling and distractions if we’re not careful. By setting guardrails and focusing on purposeful content, we can turn YouTube into a tool for self-improvement.</p>

<p>The key to harnessing YouTube’s potential lies in intentionality. Whether it’s mastering DIY repairs, building financial acumen, or staying updated with industry trends, the platform offers endless opportunities. Use it wisely, and you’ll find yourself growing in ways you never imagined.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Warranty claims in India can feel like navigating the internet with a shaky connection. Sometimes you get a swift <strong>200 OK</strong>, and other times you're stuck in an endless loop of <strong>408 Request Timeout</strong> or redirected to <strong>303 See Other Agency for Warranty</strong>. As a tech blogger and frontend developer, I thought it’d be fun to break down this often frustrating yet essential consumer process using HTTP status codes as a metaphor.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="what-the-heck-is-a-warranty">What the Heck is a Warranty?<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle#what-the-heck-is-a-warranty" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What the Heck is a Warranty?" title="Direct link to What the Heck is a Warranty?">​</a></h2>
<p>Before diving in, let's understand the basics. Warranty is a form of consumer protection where a company promises to replace or repair a product if it malfunctions within a specified period. Think of it as a service-level agreement between you and the brand, like <strong>12 months of uptime guarantee</strong> for your shiny new "Bonda" mobile charger.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="but-its-not-always-a-200-ok">But It’s Not Always a <strong>200 OK</strong>...<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle#but-its-not-always-a-200-ok" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to but-its-not-always-a-200-ok" title="Direct link to but-its-not-always-a-200-ok">​</a></h3>
<p>If companies approved every warranty claim without scrutiny, they'd be out of business. So, they create hurdles to ensure only genuine claims get through. For us consumers, this means our warranty experience can range from seamless to outright bizarre.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="the-http-status-code-guide-to-warranty-claims">The HTTP Status Code Guide to Warranty Claims<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle#the-http-status-code-guide-to-warranty-claims" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The HTTP Status Code Guide to Warranty Claims" title="Direct link to The HTTP Status Code Guide to Warranty Claims">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="200-ok-positive-case"><strong>200 OK</strong>: Positive Case<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle#200-ok-positive-case" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 200-ok-positive-case" title="Direct link to 200-ok-positive-case">​</a></h3>
<p>The consumer submits a claim with a valid invoice, and the company processes it smoothly.<br>
<!-- -->For example, my experience with a Transcend pen drive's lifetime warranty was flawless. I handed in the old one at their warehouse and walked out with a replacement. <strong>No drama, just resolution.</strong> I wish every claim was like this!</p>

<p>Instead of resolving your issue directly, the brand redirects you to a third-party service center. This often happens with products bought online. Hello, Amazon warranty maze!</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="304-untouched-were-looking-into-it"><strong>304 Untouched (We’re Looking Into It)</strong><a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle#304-untouched-were-looking-into-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 304-untouched-were-looking-into-it" title="Direct link to 304-untouched-were-looking-into-it">​</a></h4>
<p>You’ve submitted your claim, but the company keeps responding with, “Our team will get back to you soon.” Weeks pass, but nothing changes. Classic cached response with no updates.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="305-use-proxy-only-the-first-owner-gets-warranty"><strong>305 Use Proxy (Only the First Owner Gets Warranty)</strong><a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle#305-use-proxy-only-the-first-owner-gets-warranty" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 305-use-proxy-only-the-first-owner-gets-warranty" title="Direct link to 305-use-proxy-only-the-first-owner-gets-warranty">​</a></h4>
<p>Some motorcycle companies require warranty claims to be made by the original owner. If you’ve bought the motorcycle second-hand, tough luck finding the first owner or kiss the warranty goodbye.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="400-bad-request-invalid-warranty-claim"><strong>400 Bad Request (Invalid Warranty Claim)</strong><a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle#400-bad-request-invalid-warranty-claim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 400-bad-request-invalid-warranty-claim" title="Direct link to 400-bad-request-invalid-warranty-claim">​</a></h4>
<p>Misplaced your receipt? No original box? Missing serial number? Your claim is denied.<br>
<!-- -->Pro tip: Keep the computer generated bill of your purchases and warranty details in your locker.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="401-unauthorized-you-bought-it-online"><strong>401 Unauthorized (You Bought It Online)</strong><a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle#401-unauthorized-you-bought-it-online" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 401-unauthorized-you-bought-it-online" title="Direct link to 401-unauthorized-you-bought-it-online">​</a></h4>
<p>Some brands deny warranty for products bought on open-market platforms or unauthorized dealers. It's their way of saying, <em>“You didn’t play by our rules.”</em></p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="402-payment-required-hidden-costs"><strong>402 Payment Required (Hidden Costs)</strong><a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle#402-payment-required-hidden-costs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 402-payment-required-hidden-costs" title="Direct link to 402-payment-required-hidden-costs">​</a></h4>
<p>While the product part might be under warranty, labor or transportation costs aren’t. Parcel charges for small items like chargers can sometimes exceed the product’s value. Talk about irony!</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="403-forbidden-out-of-warranty-period"><strong>403 Forbidden (Out of Warranty Period)</strong><a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle#403-forbidden-out-of-warranty-period" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 403-forbidden-out-of-warranty-period" title="Direct link to 403-forbidden-out-of-warranty-period">​</a></h4>
<p>Your claim is automatically rejected because you missed the warranty window. Companies rarely extend grace periods, so you're on your own now.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="404-not-found-company-disappeared"><strong>404 Not Found (Company Disappeared)</strong><a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle#404-not-found-company-disappeared" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 404-not-found-company-disappeared" title="Direct link to 404-not-found-company-disappeared">​</a></h4>
<p>Online brands often vanish faster than seasonal discounts. By the time your product fails, the company’s customer support or even the brand itself is nowhere to be found.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="406-not-acceptable-customer-induced-damage"><strong>406 Not Acceptable (Customer-Induced Damage)</strong><a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle#406-not-acceptable-customer-induced-damage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 406-not-acceptable-customer-induced-damage" title="Direct link to 406-not-acceptable-customer-induced-damage">​</a></h4>
<p>Warranty claims for damage caused by misuse are promptly denied. Spilled coffee on your laptop? Dropped your phone? The terms and conditions were crystal clear. This one's on you.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="408-request-timeout-no-response-from-company"><strong>408 Request Timeout (No Response from Company)</strong><a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/warranty-claim-request-response-cycle#408-request-timeout-no-response-from-company" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 408-request-timeout-no-response-from-company" title="Direct link to 408-request-timeout-no-response-from-company">​</a></h4>
<p>Even with valid documents, some claims are met with silence. Eventually, you lose patience and move on.</p>

<p>Claiming a warranty in India can be as unpredictable as an HTTP request to a flaky server. From <strong>200 OK</strong> to <strong>500 Internal Server Error</strong>, your experience depends on the brand, product, and sometimes sheer luck. But with a little preparation and a lot of patience, you can improve your odds.</p>
<p>Remember, warranty claims might not always bring you joy, but at least now you can laugh about them through the lens of HTTP status codes! Hope my article also clarifies if you need to buy extened warranty. That was a good tip if you read till the last line !!.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Solar water heaters have become a common sight in households, especially in southern India where the weather is ideal for harnessing solar energy. With over five years of experience dealing with solar heaters, both in my home and those of friends, I've gathered some insights on the advantages, disadvantages, and cost savings associated with these systems.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="3-advantages-of-having-a-solar-water-heater">3 Advantages of Having a Solar Water Heater<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/3-reasons-not-to-buy-solar-water-heater-india#3-advantages-of-having-a-solar-water-heater" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3 Advantages of Having a Solar Water Heater" title="Direct link to 3 Advantages of Having a Solar Water Heater">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Instant Hot Water No need to turn on the geyser and wait for it to heat up. For families with many members, this is a game-changer. My family has become accustomed to having instant hot water 24/7.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced Electricity Bill Using solar energy means you save on electricity costs since you’re not using the electric geyser to heat water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficient Use of Solar Energy Apart from drying clothes, it's a great way to utilize solar energy efficiently.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="3-downsides-of-having-a-solar-water-heater">3 Downsides of Having a Solar Water Heater<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/3-reasons-not-to-buy-solar-water-heater-india#3-downsides-of-having-a-solar-water-heater" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3 Downsides of Having a Solar Water Heater" title="Direct link to 3 Downsides of Having a Solar Water Heater">​</a></h2>
<p>Despite the benefits, there are notable challenges with continuous ownership:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Water Shortages During summer, water shortages are common. If your overhead tank runs dry, the solar tank can't cool down, leading to cracked or broken glass tubes. If a glass tube breaks, water gushes out, potentially damaging other tubes due to the solar tank being almost empty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vacation Planning When going on vacation, ensure your overhead tank is full. If it runs dry due to evaporation, leaks, or usage, your solar heater could be damaged. Issues like monkey problems, stones, or aerial firecrackers can also break the glass tubes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plumbing, Tank Quality, and Hard Water The long-term success of a solar water heater depends on these factors. Hard water requires periodic servicing, which can cost around ₹2500. Some solar tanks, made of steel alloys, can corrode and leak. The heat from the solar tank can deform pipes, so consult with plumbers about pipe quality. Hard water exacerbates these issues, damaging water-carrying devices.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The objective of this post is to summarize the key points discussed in React Nexus 2024 conference in 100 points. I call them good parts of React Nexus 2024. I add my commentary along the way. Hope you like it and read all the way from good parts #1 to #100.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="good-parts">Good Parts<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/react-nexus-2024-good-parts#good-parts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Good Parts" title="Direct link to Good Parts">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="venue--arragements">Venue &amp; Arragements<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/react-nexus-2024-good-parts#venue--arragements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Venue &amp; Arragements" title="Direct link to Venue &amp; Arragements">​</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The selection of <a href="https://reactnexus.com/#venue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Nexus 2024 Venue</a> was Apt, not just easy for attendees but also in line with react nexus 2023 venue. Radison Blu Marathahalli is our 2 day adda (means a social gathering or hangout spot).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rockstars of the conference, the speakers were simply meritorious and profound. The full list along with their linkedin and X handles can be found on <a href="https://reactnexus.com/#speakers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Nexus Speakers Section</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conference vibe was kindled by a giant screen resembling a movie theatre and JBL speakers playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA-ChrNuyO0&amp;pp=ygUPZGVlcCBkb3BlIG11c2lj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deep dope beats</a>. Further momentum was added by <a href="https://reactnexus.com/#mcs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">charismatic emcees</a> who knew tech and humour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conference goodies included an name card tag, tshirt which is true to its size variant and few stickers. Minimalistic and useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The overall conference was jam packed with surprises like traditional yakshagana dance, activities which felt like cardio &amp; desk yoga, standup comedy, Bhangra dance which resembled flash mob, timely coffee and great food.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="day-1-of-react-nexus-2024">Day 1 of React Nexus 2024<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/react-nexus-2024-good-parts#day-1-of-react-nexus-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 of React Nexus 2024" title="Direct link to Day 1 of React Nexus 2024">​</a></h3>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<p>The first speaker was Naman Goel, spoke about "Designing for design: API decisions for long-term success". Naman is a maintainer at <a href="https://stylexjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StyleX JS</a> at Meta. He spoke about the design decisions, importance of inspiration and lineage in developing libraries and quick demos of stylex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finish your side project to be successful. I do not think this needs any explaination. Simple advice yet profound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>React was inspired by functional programming so hooks were inevitable and a natural progression. The same inspiration is a hidden force in stylex JS as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evolution of ReactJS be like.. React create class --&gt; JSX --&gt; Real classes --&gt; Functional Components --&gt; hooks --&gt; React server components..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conference talk idea. "Algebraic effects". This is a react concept which is discussed on <a href="https://overreacted.io/algebraic-effects-for-the-rest-of-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan Blog</a> and referenced in Naman Goel speech.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trade offs help us to reach the sweet spot in design decisions. I cant agree more, without tradeoff programming would be simply hard for many.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>React fiber underwent a complete rewrite 8 years ago due to which we are able to add further enhancements to React like hooks, React Server Components (RSC), etc. Its always a good value add to hear directly from maintainers at Meta.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second speaker Nurul Sundarani, spoke about "Beyond the Backend: The Rise of React Server Components". He gave a lightning introduction to React Server Components (RSC in short) and how we can use them with <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prisma</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the era of RSC, every frontend developer will be a fullstack developer too. Tools like Prisma should help you with that transformation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RSC can directly talk to databases, render only on the server so they can have API keys, good for SEO as the HTML and CSS alone can add value to the web crawlers, make the website quick by avoiding render fetch, etc.. The list goes on. Bottomline learn RSC ASAP. Good for you and your business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third speaker Akash Hamirwasia, spoke about "Enhancing your Static Sites with React Server Components". Yes, RSC can be used on the static website. Sounds contrary? then read on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://akashhamirwasia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Static websites</a> too run on a server and RSC can make use of the file server to do more. I was not able to find the code on Speaker Github but you need to know that its a possibility to do RSC on static websites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was impressed with ease and confidence with which the relatively young speaker Akash was able to put his point across the room. While I was watching his speech, I was convinced without a doubt. Bottomline, the speaker had exceeding levels of communications skills and confidence. Sometimes you pick up a thing or two non tech skills in a tech conference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fourth speaker Stefinie Fernando spoke about "Building Secure React Apps with Choreo IDevP". The software Choreo had some similarity with GCP app engine. In choreo the role of the developer ends with commiting code and packaging app into a image. The rest is taken care by Choreo platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Choreo platform boasts of complete software development cycle support ranging from CI/CD to deployment on a cluster. To playaround, visit <a href="https://wso2.com/choreo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Choreo website</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next JS which is a react framework has good levels of RSC support. Other react frameworks like remix are not behind. Think RSC, think react frameworks. RSC have friends too, they are called React server actions. <code>use server</code> directive, heard of it?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>If there were one word that was repeated a lot during react nexus 2024, it would be RSC</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="22">
<li>
<p>The fourth speaker Vamshi Suram spoke about "Scalable mock data injection into Apollo (GraphQL) Client". Overall the speaker was confortable on stage talking about his open source project <a href="https://github.com/intuit/apollo-mock-http" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apollo-mock-http</a> which helps us with data mocking even in enterprise level applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mocking should be done away from application layer so that they can be toggled with a feature switch. This is not advice specific to apollo client but frontend in general. I like this application design pattern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good mocking should not hinder or interfere with UI rendering because you loose out on the UI interactivity and animation. This advice is given with the context of react components where devs set data to props directly to mock the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fifth speaker Sweta Tanwar spoke about "Defensive Development: Testing Tactics for React Native Resilience". This was the first speech referencing React Native in React Nexus 2024. The content was actionable and could easily be blown up into a full book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defensive application development can be broken into 3 categories. Code practices, Testing and CI/CD automation. More details in the next thread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code practices include code quality checks, error handling with graceful degradation and error boundaries, component isolation before testing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testing practices include Unit testing with Jest, Integration testing with Enzyme and E2E testing with Detox/Appium. On react we are mostly talking about React testing with Vitest and playwright testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pyramid visualization was used to show that an app needs more unit tests which are efficient and integration testing at the top of the pyramid which are comprehensive. The pyramid slide will be referenced in my future discussions with architects on why unit, e2e and integration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CI/CD automation of tests can be done to catch regression issues in a automated fashion. We can use tools like circle CI, Travis, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Sixth Speaker Rajat Vijay spoke about "Experiments with AI-Generated Tests". I see the testing theme, pre lunch to be a good idea. Good job organizers. I can sense that Rajat has seen good amount of tests in his career. He clearly outlined the problem with Copilot generated tests and how he intends to fix them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rajat mentioned a tool titled "auto guardian" which instructs AI tools about the expected quality and style of testing. It looks like a config file for AI testing. I feel this would bring uniformity in the AI testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rajat spilled a few interview questions. userEvent vs fireEvent? Whats the difference and which is better. getByRole vs getByText. I will write a blog about these topics soon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rajat referenced <a href="https://www.promptingguide.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.promptingguide.ai/</a> to understand more about writing better prompts. I believe the future auto guardian would refer to these prompting standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The testing demo was fun to watch and clearly the quality of tests can be increased greatly. The link to github repo is broken. Rajat plz toggle the repo to public if its private.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The seventh speaker were from freshworks, spoke about "AI-Assisted Development: Harnessing the Freshworks Freddy Copilot Toolkit for App Development". The second sponsor speech on day 1. Its interested to see the no code movement gaining steam. Developers can build a full fledged application with a few apps and monetise on the platform. Thats insane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Freedy Copilot had lot of similarities with github copilot. It needed registration, installation on vs code, type your requirement on chat. Freedy can also deploy to their marketplace. Finally no code app generation is in reach / at times free to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The different stages from an idea to app. Requirements gathering, design, implemenation &amp; refactoring, testing can be handled by Freedy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freedy can also build UI for the developers based on the prompt. frontend engineers, gulp it down. Yes AI can build UI. Freedy relies on vision models for generating UI for freshworks marketplace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The engineering behind Freedy copilot was also discussed by second presenter Nagaraj. All I could injest into my mind were LLM, AI and more of it. Finally Day 1 Lunch hour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The post lunch first session featured a panel discussion comprising none other than the react core team from meta, how cool is that. We had Satya talk about the working on React compiler. Yes I heard it for the first time. I know only about React fiber but React compiler is a thing. True to its name, it compiles your react app into something sophisticated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The react compiler could potentially free us from writing useMemo and useCallback as the compiler could do better code optimization compared to a normal developer. However if the compiler identifies a tricky code or hacky code, it will assume that developer is the best judge and shall not mess with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In React 19, ref is a regular prop. I hope to miss forwardExoticComponentRef in my life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was a short and sweet answer to breaking changes, if you had been following the modern standards of react development. Then there are no breaking changes that should bother you. So legacy app developers brace yourself, modern app developers rejoice and upgrade to react 19.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>eslint plugin for react is now updated and optimized for react compiler. However there are many bugs that could escape the eslint and get inferred by React compiler. Code better and do not just trust eslint for react.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>React Strict DOM (RSD) is an integration of React DOM and StyleX, aiming to streamline and standardize the development of styled React components for web and native targets. We had Stylex maintainer Naman Goel talk about the possibilities of RSD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conversation quickly moved towards RSC (React Server Components) best practices. Don't waste time hydrating components that are not read/used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Render as you fetch or fetch as you render? An another interview question to note. The panel favoured Render as you fetch as mentioned this is how apps to be built be it RSC or RN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use operator is used for reading resources outside of the render. However it being a panel discussion, no demo or code was shown about the use operator. An another speech topic for potential speakers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The road ahead for react team looks like this. Compilation improvements, eslint plugin updates, lot of tooling related work is expected. I remember panel mentioning NextJS, Remix, etc. The panel discussion felt short but Tapas (the moderator) was well prepared with sharp questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The eighth speaker Prateek Surana spoke about "Elevate your routing game with TanStack Router". Definitely I felt slightly outdated or an idiot for not use tanstack router after his demo. The power and relevance for enterprise use cases were amazing and would prevent developers from reinventing the wheel around routing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tanstack router is file based, which is easy to understand and relatively hard to scale. To me the most killer feature was auto filter param rename in runtime. Let us say if param was misspelled, tanstack query can correct it for us without breaking the application</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The overall tanstack tools are squarely built around scaled react usecases which is beyond a simple ecommerce use case. I recommend checking out other tanstack tools and I am also excited to see how the tanstack fullstack comes out to be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nineth speaker Palak Bansal spoke about "Mastering Image Optimization Techniques for Web Performance in React Applications". Let us face it, images can be hard to optimize and Addy osmani has written a book about it. Palak rightly hit the nail on the head by telling "Best practices keep changing which makes image optimization harder"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Broadly there are 3 image optimization techniques that were discussed. They are lazy loading, responsive  images and image CDN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lazy loading can be done on the <img> tag with a attribute called lazy. The responsive images can be based on width of the client or pixel density of the client. Image cdn can be self managed or third party cdn which generate images on the fly specially for the client</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are wondering if the talk around image optimization is not as comprehensive as <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/image-optimization-pre-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Addy Osmani</a> book, you are right. This is a small talk format, some speeches are smaller than others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tenth speaker Jerad Rutnam spoke about "Simplify React App Login". The reasons for having a login feature are access control and personalization. But having a solid authentication logic can be hard and there were the sponsor of the event pitched his humble React component which was part of <a href="https://wso2.com/asgardeo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asgardeo sdk</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As part of Asgardeo team, the recommendation from Jerad was to delegate complex parts of the app and focus on business logic implementation which could be your goto market strategy. Cannot deny if everyone had good budget, flexibility in the code and restrictions around data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The eleventh speaker Apurv Khare spoke about "Flashpoint Performance". Is that even a thing or library or concept? Before I could stop wondering, the speaker was sprinting at the speed of flash with his speech. Lots of concepts discussed and I had tough time writing down the ideas from his speech. But the speaker knew his tools and he explained with confidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Measure performance first and optimize later. The speaker took us through different categories of performance metrics like Browser metrics, Core web vitals, Lab data &amp; Field data. The optimization techniques include compression techniques, optimizing JS, optimizing CSS, resource hints and optimized Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speaker idea was to give a crash course on measure performance and also optimizing the performance with some numbers/reports from the tools wherever required. But I do not think the speaker showed us any tool called flashpoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Browser metrics - Time To First Byte (TTFB), Speed Index. Core web vitals / User experience metrics - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Interaction to Next Paint (INP), First Input Delay (FID), Cumulative Latest Shift (CLS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here are some of the tools to measure website performance. App run at lab condition / lab data - Lighthouse, webpage test. App run at field condition / field data - Chrome UX report (CrUX), Pagespeed insights</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The network waterfall was well discussed with webpageTest and web vitals were discussed. The important performance concept, Critical Rendering Path was discussed. Of course, the speaker mentioned how CSSOM is built and how its different from JS DOM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Website performance testing on first load vs repeat load was interesting to me because we generally measure the first load only. Wherever flat text files or documents are served from server to client, we must enable one of the gzip, brottli or other compression techniques</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For optimizing JS - Pause blocking JS, defer it as much as possible. For Optimizing CSS - download CSS ASAP on the device in one chunk so that CSSOM gets built and the user can see the content rendered. Use resource hints like rel, as to pre load the content before it gets used. When prefetching multiple resources, use fetch priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The day 1 post noon, performance speeches continue. The 12th speaker and last speaker of the day was Saurabh Daware and he spoke about "Debugging Performance Issues of Your Website". The previous speech was theoretical and this speech was practical to the best.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performance issues are like any other bugs, for debugging performance issues just do not put a break point. The first place to look for is the network waterfall whenever we face an issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speaker was running a static site featuring Razorpay landing page, he demonstrated First Contentful Paint and Last Contentful Paint. The speaker attempted to showcase perceived performance optimization and how his attempted interfered with other metrics like LCP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speaker showcased how he cleverly chose to improve the perceived performance by booting the webcontainer only when code gets focus, until that point he shows the static output which gives the user the perception of fast. Its kind of fake it until you make it logic.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="day-2-of-react-nexus-2024">Day 2 of React Nexus 2024<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/react-nexus-2024-good-parts#day-2-of-react-nexus-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 2 of React Nexus 2024" title="Direct link to Day 2 of React Nexus 2024">​</a></h3>
<ol start="72">
<li>
<p>Day 2 felt somewhat slow to me as we did not waste time at registration desk. But things took a turn when we begun the day 2 with a lightening talk about Yoga. The speaker gave a mini talk focussed on breathing, expanding spine length and some posture correction tips. We need to take 10 minutes a day to see the difference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The key exercises mentioned were neck stretches, breathing slow and deep, shoulder roll, cat cow pose while sitting. If you are yoga geek, then Tadasana and Garudasana were mentioned. If you feel stiff like wood, then remember range of motion increases with consistency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 13th speaker Alex Lobera spoke about "Future-proofing state management at scale". He showcased the app he works on "Miro" and there is definitely lot of user state, sync state happening in the app. The app looks like scrum board and renders on canvas/webGL based on the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The author somehow connected the PHP era with RSC era. We were essentially connecting to DB and building UI all in one php file. We are doing the same in RSC. Just the server was not in the picture during SPA era and now its back. Congrats, everyone is now a full stack engineer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Client can access server state but server cannot access client state. The server is coming back to the picture, this time its different. The server can help us build a state in RSC era. fyi day 2 had lot of speakers flying into India for the conference. Alex was from Portugal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 14th speaker Tapas Adhikary spoke about "Do You Really Need React Query For Your Applications?". I was one of the user of React Query and I got hooked. The real threat to React Query was change in context due to RSC. Now the client can talk to DB directly. However for complex use cases we might still need tanstack query.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 15th speaker K Kamalakannan spoke about "Simplifying Complex Logic: Leveraging XState in React Development". I appreciate the state machine part, orchestration and visualization aspect of XState.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 16th speaker Ankit Tailor spoke about "How I built a Powerful Typed System?". He had worked on a design sytem called gluestack where he has authored CSS in JS which needs to be type safe. I could appreciate the use case for generic data types in designing type systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speaker mentions different aspects of DX like linting, debugging tools, typescript type checks and he showcased a CLI diagnostic tool which could show the size of generated types file which is absolutely needed for performance reasons. npx tsc --diagnostics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 16th and 17th speaker were Mike Grabowski &amp; Eric Vicenti speaking about a new paradigm "How you can Server-Render without Rendering on the Server". At the core we are trying to use web sockets to communicate with client UI on realtime to render changes. The use case was showcases interactively like a theatre play by 2 speaker on the stage with live coding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speakers showcased their npm component library which could react to our code listening via WS protocol. The links to the code or library cannot be found on google. Watch out for <a href="https://rise.tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rise.tools</a>. Not just the rendering library, rise.tools also has a component library so that developers can quickly build apps along with a playground.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 18th speaker Sanket Sahu spoke about "Building Back-End Driven Universal Apps". Conceptually Sanket is attempting to solve the same problem as Mike &amp; Eric. Instead of too much code which looks like config. We have syntactically simpler code which can be generated by chatgpt to a very high level of accuracy. Thats in line with no code development of the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 19th speaker Shruti Arya spoke about "Measuring UI performance at scale". The talk was mostly about React native app on low end android devices. The github project was called component-profiler. Surprisingly I could not catch hold of the link to it. The goal was to prevent long re-renders so that there is no jankiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 20th speaker Santosh Yadav spoke about "Improve your Developer Experience with Nx". When the pain point that Nx tries to fill was lengthy build times on any machine, be it CI/CD or cloud or local. The NX tool intelligently creates a graph of the code and precisely knows the impact of the code change. Then runs the required build tasks instead of running every single build step on the entire code base.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 21st speaker Apoorv Taneja spoke about "Creating beautiful experiences with Framer-Motion on web". <a href="https://www.framer.com/motion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Framer motion</a> helps anyone without indepth css knowledge build animations. The speaker precisely showed us how to use framer to create interactivity on the UI components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 22nd speaker Yashpreet Bathla spoke about "Avoid flickering user interfaces". The presentation deck resembled windows 95 and it was amazing. The speaker explained the concepts like call stack, micro task queue, macro task queue and render queue in detail. He also mentioned the need to maintain 60FPS, and one render in 16.6ms to have a jank free interface. He also showed how using useLayoutEffect helps in preventing jankiness when compared to useEffect</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 23rd speaker Mohit Kumar Toshniwal spoke about "Building XR applications using React Three Fiber". As speaker rightly said, the AR/VR usage has increased. Be it shopping on amazon or navigating with google maps. We can build AR/VR apps in react with react three fiber, drei, leva, react-xr etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then a panel discussion follows but this time the theme is state of react native. Panelists mentioned that react native is yet to reach v1.0.0. The expo eco system is quite mature and visiting expo.new is the way to get started with React native.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 24th speaker Neha Sharma spoke about "Connecting Worlds: Enhancing Accessibility in React Native TV Applications". Her talk was more about building accessible react native apps for smart TVs. On the mobile, the accessible is missing unlike accessible semantic html. This calls for more empathy from react native developers. The attributes like accessible are must have to make app accessible on TVs. The speaker reiterated that accessiblity is hard, its not a requirement but a feature to have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 25th speaker Siddharth Kshetrapal spoke about Building accessible reusable react components. Having worked at primer.style, he is proficient in comprehending accessiblity issues and uses his tech speaker skills to make it interesting and understandable to audience. The speaker used 2 commonly used github widgets and tried to make them accessible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Siddharth referenced the importance of <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APG</a> over WCAG in some use cases. he cleverly used the voice over to illustrate the pain, which the disabled people undergo due to our incorrect coding. I was thrilled and hooked to this speech, will certain share this speech to A11 enthusiasts.</p>

<p>I watched the react documentary trailer for the first time and happy to see the people behind React and the collective team spirit. You should watch it too, I mean the full video on youtube titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pDqJVdNa44" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"How A Small Team of Developers Created React at Facebook | React.js: The Documentary"</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sponsors were unintrusive, I was not bored by their presence on the stage or at the booth. Both of them answered the questions earnestly. The Freedy developer, aka AI tool for freshworks marketplace developers booth at the conference was showering goodies to the successful quiz winners and they had a lucky draw too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Asgardio platform which is a simple managed Authentication platform for developers conducted a workshop post the day 1 session which I felt was a generous  offering for attendees. The choreo platform which was an another stall was a useful utility for individual developers and small teams who want to have managed backend service. I love their stickers and pens kept for visitors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The audience were diverse in terms of demographics and their roots. Some of them were from students at Scalar academy, managers at Microsoft, founders of companies and in between. The Javascript community is quite strong like a giant multinational company having its subsidaries for their interests. We have JS Lovers, Chennai React, Delhi React, React Day Bangalore, team shiksha, etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emcee Jobs are hardest and demands Charisma. Aakansha Doshi was simply bold and energetic. The cardio session to beat the sleep was a masterstroke by Aakansha.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From timely humor to manager jokes, the second emcee Sahil Kalyani was equally charismatic on the stage. The third emcee Yashraj Nayak, whom I would remember for "how is the josh" was unique. He had deep connections with speakers and he was able to discuss some enjoyable anecdotes from his experience working with the speaker. Lastly "How is the Josh?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The one last thing would be the presentation aids prepared by the tech speakers were spellbound. I would appeciate the amount of time, thought and content the speakers have put into the presentations aids / PPT material. I could not differentiate if its online editor or powerpoint tools or excalidraw or just 10x creative powers of the speakers who were frontend engineers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thats enough about react nexus and my commentary on React nexus 2024, have a good day.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Amazon is used as a reference only, the issue of delivery charges is omnipresent in the ecommerce world. Treat the below article as an education material only.</p>
<p>On Amazon marketplace, the delivery charges or logistics charges are unavoidable because the amazon products are to be delivered to the customer by Amazon itself.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="amazon-charges-for-the-delivery-directly-and-indirectly">Amazon charges for the delivery directly and indirectly<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/observations-on-amazon-prime-as-a-seller#amazon-charges-for-the-delivery-directly-and-indirectly" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Amazon charges for the delivery directly and indirectly" title="Direct link to Amazon charges for the delivery directly and indirectly">​</a></h2>
<p>Amazon marketplace makes money from both sides.</p>
<ol>
<li>Money from Customers who buy on Amazon</li>
<li>Money from Sellers who sell on Amazon</li>
</ol>
<p>This is when things turn awry for me. As a seller I pay delivery charges based on multiple factors like location of the seller and how far the location is relative to the seller location. As a seller I have no visibility on if the customer is a prime member or not. Neither any discounts on prime are shown to me. As a seller, I have to factor in the delivery charges in the MRP or collect separate delivery fees. As a amazon prime member if I buy the product, I am already paying for the delivery charge which is factored into the pricing by the seller.</p>
<p>If a non amazon prime member does the purchase below the threshold, then the amazon customer has to pay delivery charges twice because the seller has already factored in, the delivery charges along with the cost price and profit.</p>
<p>But Amazon prime members are not really given any "Free Delivery" as promised, its just a waive off of an platform charge associated with Amazon. The 1499 per year is not a discount voucher for delivery charges. In fact, you might have noticed that some products are less than 50 INR in physical stores like pens but on Amazon they are 150Rs etc because of the delivery charges.</p>
<p>Overall the delivery charges are unavoidable on any ecommerce platform and diminishes the value of the sales if the shopper is not careful. To be careful, the shopper need to be aware of the prices in the real world.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="summary">Summary<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/observations-on-amazon-prime-as-a-seller#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Both Amazon Prime and Non Prime members bear the shipping charges directly and indirectly</li>
<li>As a online shopper, think of the value of the shopping transaction before you close the purchase along with myriad other quality and other concerns.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Price is what you pay, value is what you get.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://dhbalaji.dev/assets/images/coming-back-to-city-for-work-0219587ed411df531b661be0d3cf2769.webp" width="1024" height="1024" class="img_GjaX"></p>
<p>In the army, the personnel are called soldiers. In tech companies, the personnel are called resources. The army trains in camps and carries weapons. Resources work in offices, GCC, and carry laptops. In 2020 due to covid pandemic outbreak, the resources were asked to work from home. Thats how the resources experienced work from home lifestyle, the episode started. Fast forward 2024, the resources are asked to leave behind the work from home and come back to office marking the end of episode work from home, lovingly called the WFH.</p>
<p>Some companies went the extra mile and allowed the resources to work from anywhere forever. In a similar time frame, I wrote an article about <a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/WFH-vs-Remote-working#what-is-the-difference-between-wfh-and-remote-working" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work from home vs remote working</a>. The key takeaway was that working from home was a temporary fix unless the company adopted the culture mentioned in the book <a href="https://readingraphics.com/book-summary-remote-office-not-required/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote, Office Not Required</a>.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the start of 2024, almost all companies have given a first call, second call, or in some cases, a final call asking resources to get back to working from the office. This means that the comfort of working from home and the associated lifestyle is no more. But there have to be a few reasons why the back-to-office movement is happening. Of course, there are many reasons; here are a few as quoted by management.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="reasons-to-get-back-to-the-office">Reasons to get back to the office<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/from-home-comforts-to-office-the-end-of-episode-WFH#reasons-to-get-back-to-the-office" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reasons to get back to the office" title="Direct link to Reasons to get back to the office">​</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Covid is out of the picture; we can get back to the old way of working from the office. Our senior management is already doing it.</li>
<li>Operating in silos or as small teams won't boost the morale of the team or the culture of the company.</li>
<li>Use the office as a space to build your personal brand.</li>
<li>Please come to the office and use the building; we have purchased or leased it already for the long term. We have made it better in the recent renovation.</li>
<li>The economy depends on your return to the office; the cab drivers, janitors, and realtors need you.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you ask me, except for the first reason, the others should not be taken seriously.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="how-management-is-pulling-resources-back-to-the-office">How management is pulling resources back to the office<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/from-home-comforts-to-office-the-end-of-episode-WFH#how-management-is-pulling-resources-back-to-the-office" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How management is pulling resources back to the office" title="Direct link to How management is pulling resources back to the office">​</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>The company-wide call announcing mandatory work from the office for a minimum of 3 days.</li>
<li>Check if employees have punched into the office for a minimum of 3 days or 50% of working days.</li>
<li>Bring in a policy that allows reduced pay for people working remotely.</li>
<li>Bring in another policy that values presence in the office. No promotion if not working from the office. Personally, this statement is dangerous. Companies pay higher salaries to retain employees and not out of obligation. Having said that, more salary reduction could mean being on the layoff list.</li>
<li>In-office meetings and not having the option for online participation from WFH resources.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="my-reaction-to-the-back-to-office-episode">My reaction to the back-to-office episode<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/from-home-comforts-to-office-the-end-of-episode-WFH#my-reaction-to-the-back-to-office-episode" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to My reaction to the back-to-office episode" title="Direct link to My reaction to the back-to-office episode">​</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>In late 2020, after analyzing the implementation of WFH, it was clear that this was a temporary arrangement.</li>
<li>I condemn the press statements and town hall speeches by the management of tech companies in favor of working from anywhere. Everyone believed that working from home would continue forever.</li>
<li>Later in 2023, the management was the first to step into the office, followed by their immediate teams. This set an example for the whole company that working from the office is the way to conduct business.</li>
<li>Working from the office could mean perks like team lunches and client visits happening soon. Good for those with passports ready.</li>
<li>Companies need to be mindful about the transition and set the deadlines accordingly. Some employees were working in their pyjamas for long hours at home. In the work-from-office arrangement, they will waste time commuting, etc.</li>
<li>I am surprised when no management person said that working from the office is an opportunity for osmosis of ideas, easy to mentor juniors, or have fun moments. It looks like none of these happen at the workplace anymore or have been forgotten because of insufficient use.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="dont-go-to-extremes">Don't go to extremes<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/from-home-comforts-to-office-the-end-of-episode-WFH#dont-go-to-extremes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Don't go to extremes" title="Direct link to Don't go to extremes">​</a></h2>
<p>One person got into an argument where he refused to take the laptop home in the work-from-office arrangement, which led to tensions at the workplace. Accept that no system is perfect and software has bugs. In a long career span of 40 years, anything can happen. Many trends come and go.</p>
<p>We lived the WFH moment; it's time to move on.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The role of a design technologist lacks a universally accepted definition in the job market, prompting the Amazon recruiter to articulate their interpretation. As a Design Technologist at Amazon, one is expected to strike a balance between technical execution and design strategy, contributing to the creation of innovative landing pages and digital ad solutions. The ideal candidate possesses a passion for both design and development, demonstrating strong front-end proficiency, creative problem-solving skills, and a discerning eye for world-class functional design.</p>

<p>The core attributes of a design technologist encompass conveying design strategy through code, proficiency in front-end technologies, UX patterns, and best practices, building prototypes with vanilla JS and CSS, attention to detail in library maintenance, and the ability to work on multiple projects while creatively solving business challenges.</p>

<p>As a techie, managing digital spending has come with its own set of challenges, particularly when it comes to managing finances and subscriptions. One recurring issue that has cost me money on multiple occasions is the use of standing instructions for payments, where entering credit card details during free trials can lead to unforeseen financial consequences. In this blog post, I will share three instances where standing instructions resulted in financial loss and discuss strategies to mitigate these risks.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="google-cloud-the-silent-bill-accumulator">Google Cloud: The Silent Bill Accumulator<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/3-times-got-fooled-by-standing-instruction#google-cloud-the-silent-bill-accumulator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Google Cloud: The Silent Bill Accumulator" title="Direct link to Google Cloud: The Silent Bill Accumulator">​</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Same can happen on any cloud services aggregator</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google Cloud's free tier is a playground for developers, offering a range of services to experiment with. However, the requirement to enter credit card information exposes users to potential financial risks. Some dormant services can accumulate bills, and unpaid amounts accrue interest at a hefty 30% per annum. To avoid an unpleasant surprise, it is crucial for developers to actively monitor their Google Cloud billing section, even when services are in a dormant stage. While setting budgets can help control costs, it's imperative to note that alerts alone may not prevent services from running over the set limit.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="netflix-and-allies-the-subscription-renewal-trap">Netflix and Allies: The Subscription Renewal Trap<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/3-times-got-fooled-by-standing-instruction#netflix-and-allies-the-subscription-renewal-trap" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Netflix and Allies: The Subscription Renewal Trap" title="Direct link to Netflix and Allies: The Subscription Renewal Trap">​</a></h2>
<p>Managing media consumption subscriptions can be challenging, especially when juggling multiple platforms. To optimize costs, my family cycles through apps every two months to watch all available titles without paying for them simultaneously. The challenge lies in remembering to cancel subscriptions before they auto-renew. Forgetting to do so results in wasted money. Vigilance and regular subscription audits are essential to avoid unnecessary charges.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="overcharging-after-subscription-renewal">Overcharging after Subscription Renewal<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/3-times-got-fooled-by-standing-instruction#overcharging-after-subscription-renewal" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Overcharging after Subscription Renewal" title="Direct link to Overcharging after Subscription Renewal">​</a></h2>
<p>Yearly renewing subscriptions often come with an unwelcome surprise—the increased subscription price. Unfortunately, standing instructions automatically accept the higher cost, even if the renewed service may no longer be worth the investment. To prevent this, it's crucial to reassess the value of the service before allowing standing instructions to renew it automatically.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Maintain a Detailed Record: Create and regularly update an Excel sheet containing all websites where you've authorized standing instructions for payments. This centralized record will serve as a quick reference and aid in monitoring financial commitments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stay Informed: Actively monitor notifications and emails related to payments and billing. Ignoring these alerts can lead to unintended financial consequences. Stay informed to take timely action. In India we have sihub website where we can see all the autopay instructions in one place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seek Remedies: In case of discrepancies or unexpected charges, don't hesitate to seek help from customer support. Engage with the respective platforms to find a suitable remedy, which might include closing an account or modifying standing instructions.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>As a techie, navigating the world of standing instructions requires diligence and strategic planning. By learning from my experiences with Google Cloud, media subscriptions, and renewal surprises, you can implement proactive strategies to avoid financial losses. Maintain meticulous records, stay informed, and don't hesitate to seek help when needed. With these precautions, you can enjoy the benefits of standing instructions without falling victim to their potential pitfalls.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://dhbalaji.dev/assets/images/students-near-pump-66fcd2975e488c203e3fef5d15ab70af.jpg" width="1279" height="853" class="img_GjaX"></p>
<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of technical blogs, where discussions often revolve around technology trends, career advice, and personal life hacks, there emerges a new wave of content – one rooted in societal impact. Enter DSR, or Developer Social Responsibility, a concept akin to the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) undertaken by companies.</p>
<p>Traditionally, major corporations like Tata Consultancy Services (TCSL) allocate a portion of their resources towards community-centric initiatives through CSR. In a similar vein, I, as a developer, am embarking on a novel journey – utilizing my platform to craft posts that serve the local community or residents of my locality. The underlying ethos of DSR is to provide valuable information that may not be readily available in the public domain, thereby bridging knowledge gaps and fostering a sense of community support.</p>
<p>Understanding the Principles of DSR Posts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Conciseness is Key:</strong>
DSR posts will embody brevity without compromising on substance. By distilling information into concise and digestible content, the aim is to deliver maximum value in a minimal timeframe. This ensures that readers can easily assimilate the information and apply it to their lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Positive Tone:</strong>
DSR posts will steer clear of a complaining or negative tone. The objective is to inspire and uplift, offering solutions and insights that empower readers rather than dwelling on issues. This positive approach not only resonates better with the audience but also aligns with the constructive spirit of social responsibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limited Social Media Promotion:</strong>
Unlike conventional blog posts that often rely heavily on social media channels for promotion, DSR posts will take a different route. By abstaining from aggressive promotion on platforms, the focus remains on organic reach and genuine engagement. This approach ensures that the content reaches those genuinely interested in community-centric information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In adopting the DSR framework, the intention is clear: to create content that transcends the digital realm and makes a tangible impact on the lives of individuals within the community. This initiative seeks to foster a sense of responsibility among developers, urging them to leverage their skills and knowledge for the betterment of society.</p>
<p>As the DSR journey unfolds, the commitment to concise, positive, and community-centric content remains steadfast. By embracing this unique approach, developers can play an active role in shaping a more informed, empowered, and connected society, one blog post at a time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a world inundated with financial advice, it's surprising that many young professionals, especially the techies, still find themselves struggling financially. As someone who has risen from financial difficulties, I feel compelled to share my insights in what might be my last blog post on personal finance. This one's dedicated to my fellow bachelor employee countrymen who are navigating the complexities of finances without a strategy. Remember you need money from even before you are born and after you are dead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TLDR: This article is my last blog article about financial planning for bachelor techies in India.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understanding the Types:</p>
<p>I've observed that bachelor techies can be broadly classified into two types:</p>
<p><strong>Type 1:</strong> No Debt</p>
<p><strong>Type 2:</strong> Have Debt</p>
<p>Let us assume your salary is 100 INR in your bank account, how to allocate salary of 100 INR? Now, let's delve into the nitty-gritty of an ideal financial plan based on your type.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Depending on your salary, you may adjust the percentage split but ensure you have plan to send money into each category.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="type-1-no-debt">Type 1: No Debt<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/the-last-personal-finance-advice-techies#type-1-no-debt" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Type 1: No Debt" title="Direct link to Type 1: No Debt">​</a></h3>
<p>For those fortunate enough to have no outstanding commitments, allocating your salary wisely is relatively simple:</p>
<p>First Batch - Investment</p>
<ol>
<li>15Rs: Retirement Savings</li>
<li>15Rs: Stocks/Business</li>
<li>15Rs: Short-Term Savings</li>
</ol>
<p>Second Batch - Expenses</p>
<ol>
<li>20Rs: Rent/HRA</li>
<li>20Rs: General Expenses</li>
</ol>
<p>Third Batch - Others</p>
<ol>
<li>5Rs: Discretionary</li>
<li>5Rs: Parents/Cultural Expenses</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="type-2-have-debt">Type 2: Have Debt<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/the-last-personal-finance-advice-techies#type-2-have-debt" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Type 2: Have Debt" title="Direct link to Type 2: Have Debt">​</a></h3>
<p>If you find yourself burdened with loans, a strategic approach is necessary:</p>
<p>Priority Batch - Debt Servicing</p>
<ol>
<li>25Rs: EMI</li>
<li>10Rs: Principal Repayment</li>
</ol>
<p>First Batch - Investment</p>
<ol>
<li>5Rs: Retirement Savings</li>
<li>5Rs: Stocks/Business</li>
<li>10Rs: Short-Term Savings</li>
</ol>
<p>Second Batch - Expenses</p>
<ol>
<li>20Rs: Rent/HRA</li>
<li>20Rs: General Expenses</li>
</ol>
<p>Third Batch - Others</p>
<ol>
<li>5Rs: Parents/Cultural Expenses</li>
</ol>

<p>Two critical points emerge from these allocations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Survival Mode: Until your loans are fully serviced, you're essentially in survival mode. This phase might be tough, but it's essential to secure a healthy financial future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Future Planning: Without a strategic approach, you might compromise your financial stability in the long run.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="other-tips">Other Tips<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/the-last-personal-finance-advice-techies#other-tips" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Other Tips" title="Direct link to Other Tips">​</a></h2>
<p>Apart from allocating your salary smartly, consider these practical tips to bolster your financial health:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Debt Refinancing: Explore options to reduce interest rates on existing loans. If possible, avoid debt leverage to raise wealth or buy consumables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lean Lifestyle: Embrace a frugal lifestyle and look for value buys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family Support: Seek assistance from family to share the financial burden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expense Prevention: Avoid unnecessary expenses that can lead to a chain of additional financial burdens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health and Safety: Maintain a healthy lifestyle to prevent unexpected medical expenses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2024/the-last-personal-finance-advice-techies#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>Everyone aspires to retire peacefully with financial security. Being in survival mode, you cannot retire even in your old age. In a world where loans and notices clutter newspapers, leading a debt-free life simplifies everything. As bachelor techies, understanding your financial type and making strategic decisions today will pave the way for a secure and stress-free tomorrow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Newspapers would have less pages if nobody defaulted on their loans. Your life would be simple and stress free without debt.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Useless Youtube Gear]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Useless Youtube Gear" src="https://dhbalaji.dev/assets/images/youtube-camera-gear-0626be2f30f9f04906087fb992243d30.webp" width="1280" height="853" class="img_GjaX"></p>
<p>In the pursuit of YouTube success, many content creators find themselves on a quest for the perfect gadgets to enhance their production quality. I too embarked on this journey, investing in four gadgets with the hope of elevating my content. However, hindsight has brought clarity, revealing that these purchases did not contribute significantly to my YouTube success. In this blog post, I'll delve into each gadget and share the lessons learned.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="1-whiteboard-and-marker-pens-simplicity-vs-practicality">1. Whiteboard and Marker Pens: Simplicity vs. Practicality<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2023/4-useless-gadgets-purchased-for-youtube#1-whiteboard-and-marker-pens-simplicity-vs-practicality" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Whiteboard and Marker Pens: Simplicity vs. Practicality" title="Direct link to 1. Whiteboard and Marker Pens: Simplicity vs. Practicality">​</a></h2>
<p>At first glance, a whiteboard and marker pens seemed like a practical investment to recreate a classroom setting for content demonstrations. However, I soon realized that this setup required a level of confidence and was better suited for academic content. For my YouTube endeavors, originality, presentation, uniqueness, and searchability took precedence over the traditional classroom approach.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="2-digital-pens-the-unanticipated-learning-curve">2. Digital Pens: The Unanticipated Learning Curve<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2023/4-useless-gadgets-purchased-for-youtube#2-digital-pens-the-unanticipated-learning-curve" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Digital Pens: The Unanticipated Learning Curve" title="Direct link to 2. Digital Pens: The Unanticipated Learning Curve">​</a></h2>
<p>Digital pens promised seamless scribbling and emphasis during screen sharing. Unfortunately, the reality included a steep learning curve. The basic digital pen I initially purchased turned out to be of little use without acquiring the specific skills needed. This experience underscored the importance of thoroughly researching and understanding the tools before making a purchase.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="3-software-for-editing-a-windows-update-and-more">3. Software for Editing: A Windows Update and More<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2023/4-useless-gadgets-purchased-for-youtube#3-software-for-editing-a-windows-update-and-more" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. Software for Editing: A Windows Update and More" title="Direct link to 3. Software for Editing: A Windows Update and More">​</a></h2>
<p>Video editing is an indispensable aspect of content creation, and I invested time in updating my Windows and learning the nuances of video editing. While I achieved some success, the hardware limitations of my PC hindered the production of high-quality, full-HD videos. This realization highlighted the need for a balance between software proficiency and hardware capabilities to meet the standards of modern YouTube content.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="4-lavalier-microphone-battling-ambient-noise">4. Lavalier Microphone: Battling Ambient Noise<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2023/4-useless-gadgets-purchased-for-youtube#4-lavalier-microphone-battling-ambient-noise" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4. Lavalier Microphone: Battling Ambient Noise" title="Direct link to 4. Lavalier Microphone: Battling Ambient Noise">​</a></h2>
<p>Capturing pristine audio in a less-than-ideal environment posed a significant challenge. Despite the assistance of a lavalier microphone, the ambient noise from barking dogs and honking drivers persisted, preventing the attainment of studio-quality audio. This experience emphasized the importance of considering the external factors that can impact audio quality and exploring alternative solutions.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="conclusion-a-pragmatic-approach-to-youtube-success">Conclusion: A Pragmatic Approach to YouTube Success<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2023/4-useless-gadgets-purchased-for-youtube#conclusion-a-pragmatic-approach-to-youtube-success" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion: A Pragmatic Approach to YouTube Success" title="Direct link to Conclusion: A Pragmatic Approach to YouTube Success">​</a></h2>
<p>In conclusion, achieving YouTube success requires a blend of skills, awareness, and time commitment—factors that I found myself lacking. While certain gadgets, like a camera stand and a reliable camera phone, proved to be useful, the shift towards shorts and reels emerged as a more practical strategy. Testing content with shorter formats allows creators to gauge audience response without the need for an expensive infrastructure required for full-length videos.</p>
<p>Aspiring YouTubers should prioritize understanding their niche, refining their content, and gradually investing in tools that align with their evolving needs. Rather than hastily diving into full-length videos, a strategic focus on shorts and reels can provide valuable insights and pave the way for a more sustainable path to YouTube success.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To grow Youtube channel in a lean way, focus of shorts creation and pivot in a inexpensive way</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="introduction">Introduction:<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2023/bye-youtube-content-creation#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction:" title="Direct link to Introduction:">​</a></h2>
<p>In the dynamic world of content creation, platforms like YouTube have played a pivotal role in connecting creators with their audiences. As someone who embarked on a YouTube journey in 2020, I experienced the highs and lows of content creation. However, after three years of dedication, I found myself at a crossroads, leading me to make the tough decision to step away from the platform. In this post, I'll delve into the three primary reasons that prompted me to bid farewell to YouTube and explore an alternative path that aligns better with my goals.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="reason-1-landscape-has-changed">Reason 1: Landscape has changed<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2023/bye-youtube-content-creation#reason-1-landscape-has-changed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reason 1: Landscape has changed" title="Direct link to Reason 1: Landscape has changed">​</a></h2>
<p>The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic saw a surge in content creation as people sought new ways to spend their time. The demand for content was high, but by 2023, the landscape had transformed significantly. Educational content creators faced a daunting challenge of standing out amidst the crowd pullers like news, comics, and film-related content. Unfortunately, educational content struggled to capture the audience's attention, making it increasingly challenging for solo creators to thrive.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="reason-2-posted-content-does-not-get-promoted">Reason 2: Posted content does not get promoted<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2023/bye-youtube-content-creation#reason-2-posted-content-does-not-get-promoted" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reason 2: Posted content does not get promoted" title="Direct link to Reason 2: Posted content does not get promoted">​</a></h2>
<p>While YouTube serves as a vast platform with immense potential, getting content noticed became an uphill battle. The algorithmic changes and sheer volume of content meant that creators had to rely on their existing subscriber base or invest in promotional efforts. For those starting from scratch, breaking through the noise proved to be as challenging as finding a needle in a haystack. The lack of organic promotion made it difficult for new creators without a substantial audience to showcase their work.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="reason-3-form-over-content">Reason 3: Form over content<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2023/bye-youtube-content-creation#reason-3-form-over-content" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reason 3: Form over content" title="Direct link to Reason 3: Form over content">​</a></h2>
<p>The evolution of content creation standards brought forth new challenges. The days when a front camera sufficed for creating engaging content are long gone. Today, success demands high-quality cameras, aesthetically pleasing backgrounds, captivating thumbnail graphics, and more. The time-consuming process of adhering to these visual standards often took away from the core focus – the content itself. This shift towards a more polished presentation, while visually appealing, did not necessarily translate into increased viewership.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="alternative">Alternative<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2023/bye-youtube-content-creation#alternative" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Alternative" title="Direct link to Alternative">​</a></h2>
<p>In light of these challenges, I've decided to retreat from YouTube content creation and refocus my efforts on traditional blogging. Leveraging the power of AI tools, my blogging endeavors have seen a resurgence. The efficiency and effectiveness of these tools have allowed me to rediscover the joy of content creation without the constraints and challenges posed by the ever-evolving landscape of YouTube.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="conclusion">Conclusion:<a href="https://dhbalaji.dev/blog/2023/bye-youtube-content-creation#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion:" title="Direct link to Conclusion:">​</a></h2>
<p>The decision to step away from YouTube was not made lightly, and it's essential for content creators to regularly reassess their chosen platforms. While YouTube remains a giant in the industry, the shifting landscape and challenges faced by solo creators necessitate adaptability. For those seeking a more flexible and personally fulfilling creative outlet, exploring alternative mediums, like traditional blogging with AI enhancements, might prove to be the key to sustained success and satisfaction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hey there, lets discuss an interesting short, light and no nonsense read from the `self help` genre. Most self help books try to address one or more than one broad problem in life. This book is no different in that aspect. As the title suggests, this book attempts to solve problems related to 

1. Procrastination
2. Focus
3. Meaning in life

## About the author

A book cannot be seperated from the author because its the author who gave its form and contents. So the authors personality gets into the book. After reading the book, here is what I understand about the author.

The author is a seeker, doer and wishes to be deterministic about what he does in life. He seems to avoid the `digital` life. He is cautious about the time drainers however he says he is not a robot and consumes entertainment.

Overall I like the author because his advice/tips are relevant for the modern times.

## Ground breaking ideas from the book

Its a short self help book which itself looks like a book summary. From that content, here are my favorite ideas.

### Turn off wifi by default

I like this idea because I know successful people and peers at work who have benefitted by this policy. They would turn off data/notifications on the phone. The phone is used only for calls/SMS. I know of people who would reply to whatsapp messages once a week, they are quite ahead of the normal people.

At home, turning off the wifi can be helpful to focus on other aspects of life.


### Focus on things other than job

As an adult, we are our job. We are identified by our job, trusted by banks based on our job so we get attached or dedicated to our job and ignore the rest. Here are other important things of life.

- Reading
- Exercising
- Investing
- Saving
- Spending time with people etc

### To cut procrastination, boost productivity

Inspite of a million motivation videos, if we do not love what we do, we are most likely procrastinate or give up on it. So find something you love to do.

> Do the important things today not tomorrow

Recipe for good life. Focus on what you want and eliminate the rest.

## Verdict

Paying bills is important but there is something more to life than bills itself. 

Overall an interesting short, crisp read which focusses on tactics over techniques for boosting productivity and beating procrastination.

In most places, the author has picked and phrased the best practices and ideas from other books which helps us to remember those ideas as well. 

- For instance, the pomodoro timer for crushing the work in front of you, we have heard of the same idea from multiple sources.
- Plan the next day before we hit the bed, we have heard this many times but the authors improves the idea by asking you to visulize how you would feel when you get the tasks done tomorrow.

This book is recommended for people who want to guard their time, build focus and improve their productivity.

I have been reading books about all things that matter in life. This is the first book about the most important place on earth "The Home". Each ones home is unique and I am going to talk about this book from a working class person living in India.

## About the author

The author is a minimalist guru and a staunch advocate of minimalism. If you are going to search for the word minimalist on any search engine or social media platform, you might run into the works of Joshua Becker. He has written multiple books on the topic of minimalism.

One of the ideas from his previous books which I follow meticulously is `remove duplicates`. Have 2 towels instead of 5. Wash the blankets and use it within same day. You do not need to maintain multiple blankets.

## Why minimalism

> Prioritize extra time in hand, extra money in pocket over extra things in the closet.

I wanted you to observe people around you. Some of them are super focussed on the things they do and deterministic about the things they own. While a vast majority of them are otherwise. If you lift your head and observe some legendary people like Steve Jobs & Mahatma Gandhi, they were leading a minimalist life. They were spearheaded about the mission of their life. Both Steve Jobs & Gandhi were not popular because they wore fancy dresses/clothing most of the time. They did not own fancy homes but the outcome of their work and the value they brought to the world is immeasurable. 

In success literature, its a trend to observe and reverse engineer the qualities of successful people or reversing the trend which is followed by masses. In this context `minimalism` has hit a niche market and there is a good amount of education, adoption and evangalism available out there.

Lets answer the `why`, Minimalism is a philosophy so its hard to punch in a scientific definition to minimalism. Minimalism is about focussing on things that matter to you and your goal in life. A minimalist tries to turn his sorroundings, tools and thoughts towards the main goal in life.

Lets observe Steve Jobs, he believed in good design. According to Jobs, design is not how it looks but how it works. His car, dress, office, products and his entire life was obssesively driven by design instead of being missold to random ideas or whims of the market. Nevertheless, he acheived greate things in life.

## Top ideas from the book

The book is written around the topic "Home". The author prescribes about how to approach each room as a minimalist. Of course, if you were to follow this book. You might expect trouble from your family or room mates and the author has written about that too.

> If your house does not have a basement, then your bed storage is your basement.

### Stuff problem

Once in a while, the Indian moms yell at their child for bringing home something useless. But the child feels its the best thing they could buy in their life. As a grown up adult, I purchased few things which I am not proud of like expensive home gym equipment which was not used at all. My mom complained right on the day of purchase and even showed me alternates like running or using body weight. Lets say I did not have a mom and I go binge shopping. I would be left with 10 items sitting on the floor because they did not have a shelf to sit all the time. My room would turn into a cave with all sort of things that I do not use. Thats exactly the author calls out as stuff problem. 

> If you have nice things to impress your friends, then you got wrong friends.

People with stuff problem have trouble with shifting homes, spending more time on the upkeep and lastly they cannot say where their things are. They keep misplacing things and spend lot of time searching for them. Simple things like walking in the dark is not easy because they have stuff sitting on the floor. I have personal seen some Indian homes where the guests can clearly call out as a mess. Some guests would even give advice like "why don't you clear of the text books from school which are stacked up on the floor at a corner of the room.

> Nothing on the floor except 4 pieces of furniture per room.

### Minimalism dividend

If you were given a chance to go back in time and you were given a full refund for exchanging all the things you emotionally bought, how would more extra cash you would have? You would be definitely having more money today. Imagine if you had invested correctly instead of buying things, that investment would have given you dividends.

If the above advice sounds too strict, here it out. As a minimalist, you will buy things and some of your purchases might end up as clutter. But compared to a normal soul who is spending on things and loading his house with 30,000 items, you are doing much better.

Do not go by what advertisers call it out as trend like colors to wear this summer etc. By not falling into consumerism, you avoid debts. This is a advantage of being a minimalist and this is what the author calls out as "Minimalism Dividend" just like stock dividend.

> Refusal to buy things that waste money and take up clutter pays you minimalist dividends.

### Do not relocate items

Most of us have did this. Lets say you purchased a flower vase thinking you would decorate with beautiful flowers once a week. But as time goes by, the flowers cost and upkeep makes you wonder if its worth it. In that case, you accept the defeat and pack the vase and relocate the vase from display to a box in the basement. The Indian version is "top shelf of the room or below the bed". Thats it, you forget and move on but that item is still sitting somewhere and adding to clutter count.

Instead the author recommends you to donate or sell it on garage sale. The Indian equivalent of garage sale is `olx`. Either use the item or discard it. Before you discard, run it through a small checklist like if your family member would get angry, when did you last use it?, etc.


## Ideas I do not agree with

At the shopping mall or super market, the things we buy fall into 2 categories. They are `Consumables` & `Durables`. The `Consumables` are like food items, natural flowers, etc. The `Durables` are like books, toys and furniture. The author recommends buying consumables instead of durables as the consumables are spent for experiences but later is bought for future use.

I like what the author says. Sometimes the books we do not start reading the books we read but we hold it thinking we will read it someday. The same with the DSLR camera which we bought. Authors advocates renting durables.

Having said that its a noble idea to vote for consumables but not all consumables are safe. What if someone buys addictive substance because he is not going to spend on durable. Its a possibility. 

The Indian version would be to ask your mom/spouse to supervise the money for you. It works most of the time. 

> For investments, contact an advisor. For spending, you need a regulator.

## Verdict

Overall the book is a intermediate level read where the reader is supposed to read and make changes not just to himself but to the lifestlye of the family. Goals of each room, refusal to buy things which do not bring value or simply clutter are absolutely great ideas to explore at a young age. 

If you are someone who walks with a plan, integrates parts of your life by design and willing to be counter cultured, this book is for you. I will leave you with a quote from the book which I believe is so true.

> Picture your dream home in the mind, I bet its not filled with clutter

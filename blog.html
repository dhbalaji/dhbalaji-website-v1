But have you ever considered the power of a <strong>not-to-do list</strong>? It&#x27;s about consciously identifying habits or activities that no longer serve your goals and removing them. Here&#x27;s my not-to-do list for 2025, crafted with the intent to stay focused, efficient, and aligned with my evolving priorities.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="1-no-more-public-github-repos">1. No More Public GitHub Repos<a href="#1-no-more-public-github-repos" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. No More Public GitHub Repos" title="Direct link to 1. No More Public GitHub Repos">​</a></h2>
<p>Open-source contribution has been a cornerstone of the tech world, and I’ve had my share of excitement from it. But with the rise of AI tools, the landscape is changing. Unless you’re a core maintainer of a prominent library, the recognition that once came from showcasing code has diminished.</p>
<p>In 2025, I’ll shift my energy toward <strong>building meaningful products and functionalities</strong> rather than maintaining a public code showcase. The focus will be on solving problems and creating impact—where the real value lies.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="2-no-social-media-overload">2. No Social Media Overload<a href="#2-no-social-media-overload" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. No Social Media Overload" title="Direct link to 2. No Social Media Overload">​</a></h2>
<p>Social media can be a double-edged sword. It’s a goldmine for networking, but it’s also a time sink designed for immersion and doomscrolling. With AI tools providing quick insights (even without sitting through a 40-minute video), my reliance on these platforms will be minimal.</p>
<p>Here’s my plan: <strong>Engage with social media just once a week for an hour</strong>, in the following order:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Facebook</strong> for personal updates.</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn</strong> for professional networking.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Feed</strong> to track industry trends.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter/X</strong> for niche topics and hot takes.</li>
<li><strong>YouTube Subscriptions</strong> for targeted learning.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, I’ll curate a list of websites to stay updated instead of depending on algorithm-driven feeds.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="3-no-two-visits-per-week-to-office">3. No Two Visits Per Week To Office<a href="#3-no-two-visits-per-week-to-office" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. No Two Visits Per Week To Office" title="Direct link to 3. No Two Visits Per Week To Office">​</a></h2>
<p>Working from the office puts you into a routine which is a supporting stick for those who lack self discipline of waking up early, switching subjects under work naturally. Thats why I am against working from office on select days of the week.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="4-no-more-reading-goals">4. No More Reading Goals<a href="#4-no-more-reading-goals" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4. No More Reading Goals" title="Direct link to 4. No More Reading Goals">​</a></h2>
<p>I used to pride myself on being a voracious reader, devouring two books a week. But life evolves, and so do habits. For two consecutive years, I failed to hit my reading goals—and that’s okay.</p>
<p>In 2025, I’ll stop setting rigid reading goals. Instead, I’ll use mobile apps that provide <strong>daily book summaries</strong> to stay updated with the latest titles. Physical books will still have a place in my collection, but the pressure to meet arbitrary goals will be a thing of the past.</p>

<p>Video courses are everywhere—just one click away. But they often require hours of commitment, and many simply repackage information available in documentation or books.</p>
<p>Moving forward, I’ll treat video courses as a <strong>last resort</strong>. I’ll prioritize <strong>reading documentation</strong>, <strong>experimenting</strong>, and leveraging AI for quick answers. If I still hit roadblocks, only then will I invest time in a course. The same logic applies to interviews or tutorials—AI can summarize key insights faster than a 60-minute watch.</p>

<p>2025 is about <strong>action over abstraction</strong>. Instead of endlessly documenting best practices or creating small libraries, I’ll focus on:</p>

<p>YouTube has become an indispensable part of our daily lives. From entertainment to education, it’s a treasure trove of information waiting to be tapped. However, like any tool, its impact depends on how we use it. By channeling our time on YouTube towards productive endeavors, we can unlock immense value. Here are three transformative lessons I’ve learned from YouTube in 2024, which have reshaped my perspective and enriched my life.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="1-diy-laptop-and-motorcycle-repairs-empower-yourself">1. DIY Laptop and Motorcycle Repairs: Empower Yourself<a href="#1-diy-laptop-and-motorcycle-repairs-empower-yourself" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1.

<p>Nothing is more frustrating than being technically inclined yet unable to handle minor repairs. For many, minor fixes—whether it’s a laptop issue or a motorcycle—are often overlooked by mechanics or seen as unworthy of their time. Insurance companies don’t cover such small mishaps, and for the owner, they’re just time-wasters. But learning to perform these tasks yourself is a game-changer.</p>
<p>Through YouTube, I’ve gained the confidence to tackle these challenges. DIY repair videos have become my go-to resource before making any major purchases. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most business-grade laptops have detailed repair tutorials available.</li>
<li>Popular vehicles, like Maruti cars, also have a wealth of content explaining common issues and fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This newfound skill has transformed how I make purchase decisions. DIY repairability is now a core factor in my selection framework. The ability to fix things with my own hands not only saves money but also fosters a sense of independence and ownership.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Before buying any big or expensive item, check if it is DIY repair-friendly. It can save you a lot of hassle down the line.</p>

<p>Conversations around finance often revolve around trades, insurance, or IPOs, but rarely delve into overarching financial frameworks or strategies for building wealth. Thanks to YouTube, we can now access diverse perspectives and stories from people at different stages of their financial journey.</p>
<p>Just today, I watched two fascinating videos:</p>
<ol>
<li>A story about a betting addict burdened by debt—a cautionary tale of financial mismanagement.</li>
<li>The inspiring journey of a top-level executive who retired early to live sustainably on a farm. Their financial strategy included years of disciplined saving and investments, supplemented by income from startups. Here’s their asset allocation:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>40% in real estate, including their farm.</li>
<li>40% in equities and mutual funds.</li>
<li>10% in gold.</li>
<li>10% in liquid funds for emergencies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These narratives offer invaluable insights and practical frameworks for managing personal finances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Before you quit your job, ensure you have a solid financial runway. Asset allocation is crucial for long-term stability.</p>

<p>For developers and tech enthusiasts, attending global conferences like Next.js Conf or Google I/O often seems like a distant dream. Enter YouTube, the ultimate equalizer. With live streams and recorded sessions, anyone, anywhere, can stay updated on the latest trends and technologies.</p>
<p>This year, I tuned into multiple tech events that would have been impossible to attend in person. These events not only kept me informed but also inspired me to stay ahead in my career. The ability to access these resources at your convenience is a game-changer for lifelong learning.</p>

<p>YouTube is undoubtedly a powerful platform for learning and growth. However, navigating it effectively requires discipline. The abundance of content can quickly lead to doom-scrolling and distractions if we’re not careful. By setting guardrails and focusing on purposeful content, we can turn YouTube into a tool for self-improvement.</p>

<p>Warranty claims in India can feel like navigating the internet with a shaky connection. Sometimes you get a swift <strong>200 OK</strong>, and other times you&#x27;re stuck in an endless loop of <strong>408 Request Timeout</strong> or redirected to <strong>303 See Other Agency for Warranty</strong>. As a tech blogger and frontend developer, I thought it’d be fun to break down this often frustrating yet essential consumer process using HTTP status codes as a metaphor.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="what-the-heck-is-a-warranty">What the Heck is a Warranty?<a href="#what-the-heck-is-a-warranty" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What the Heck is a Warranty?" title="Direct link to What the Heck is a Warranty?">​</a></h2>
<p>Before diving in, let&#x27;s understand the basics. Warranty is a form of consumer protection where a company promises to replace or repair a product if it malfunctions within a specified period. Think of it as a service-level agreement between you and the brand, like <strong>12 months of uptime guarantee</strong> for your shiny new &quot;Bonda&quot; mobile charger.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="but-its-not-always-a-200-ok">But It’s Not Always a <strong>200 OK</strong>...<a href="#but-its-not-always-a-200-ok" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to but-its-not-always-a-200-ok" title="Direct link to but-its-not-always-a-200-ok">​</a></h3>
<p>If companies approved every warranty claim without scrutiny, they&#x27;d be out of business. So, they create hurdles to ensure only genuine claims get through. For us consumers, this means our warranty experience can range from seamless to outright bizarre.</p>

<p>The consumer submits a claim with a valid invoice, and the company processes it smoothly.<br>
<!-- -->For example, my experience with a Transcend pen drive&#x27;s lifetime warranty was flawless. I handed in the old one at their warehouse and walked out with a replacement. <strong>No drama, just resolution.</strong> I wish every claim was like this!</p>

<p>Instead of resolving your issue directly, the brand redirects you to a third-party service center. This often happens with products bought online. Hello, Amazon warranty maze!</p>

<p>Claiming a warranty in India can be as unpredictable as an HTTP request to a flaky server. From <strong>200 OK</strong> to <strong>500 Internal Server Error</strong>, your experience depends on the brand, product, and sometimes sheer luck. But with a little preparation and a lot of patience, you can improve your odds.</p>
<p>Remember, warranty claims might not always bring you joy, but at least now you can laugh about them through the lens of HTTP status codes! Hope my article also clarifies if you need to buy extened warranty.

With over five years of experience dealing with solar heaters, both in my home and those of friends, I&#x27;ve gathered some insights on the advantages, disadvantages, and cost savings associated with these systems.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="3-advantages-of-having-a-solar-water-heater">3 Advantages of Having a Solar Water Heater<a href="#3-advantages-of-having-a-solar-water-heater" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3 Advantages of Having a Solar Water Heater" title="Direct link to 3 Advantages of Having a Solar Water Heater">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Instant Hot Water No need to turn on the geyser and wait for it to heat up. For families with many members, this is a game-changer. My family has become accustomed to having instant hot water 24/7.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced Electricity Bill Using solar energy means you save on electricity costs since you’re not using the electric geyser to heat water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficient Use of Solar Energy Apart from drying clothes, it&#x27;s a great way to utilize solar energy efficiently.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="3-downsides-of-having-a-solar-water-heater">3 Downsides of Having a Solar Water Heater<a href="#3-downsides-of-having-a-solar-water-heater" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3 Downsides of Having a Solar Water Heater" title="Direct link to 3 Downsides of Having a Solar Water Heater">​</a></h2>
<p>Despite the benefits, there are notable challenges with continuous ownership:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Water Shortages During summer, water shortages are common. If your overhead tank runs dry, the solar tank can&#x27;t cool down, leading to cracked or broken glass tubes. If a glass tube breaks, water gushes out, potentially damaging other tubes due to the solar tank being almost empty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vacation Planning When going on vacation, ensure your overhead tank is full. If it runs dry due to evaporation, leaks, or usage, your solar heater could be damaged. Issues like monkey problems, stones, or aerial firecrackers can also break the glass tubes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plumbing, Tank Quality, and Hard Water The long-term success of a solar water heater depends on these factors. Hard water requires periodic servicing, which can cost around ₹2500. Some solar tanks, made of steel alloys, can corrode and leak. The heat from the solar tank can deform pipes, so consult with plumbers about pipe quality. Hard water exacerbates these issues, damaging water-carrying devices.</p>

<li>
<p>The selection of <a href="https://reactnexus.com/#venue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Nexus 2024 Venue</a> was Apt, not just easy for attendees but also in line with react nexus 2023 venue. Radison Blu Marathahalli is our 2 day adda (means a social gathering or hangout spot).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rockstars of the conference, the speakers were simply meritorious and profound. The full list along with their linkedin and X handles can be found on <a href="https://reactnexus.com/#speakers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Nexus Speakers Section</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conference vibe was kindled by a giant screen resembling a movie theatre and JBL speakers playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA-ChrNuyO0&amp;pp=ygUPZGVlcCBkb3BlIG11c2lj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deep dope beats</a>. Further momentum was added by <a href="https://reactnexus.com/#mcs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">charismatic emcees</a> who knew tech and humour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conference goodies included an name card tag, tshirt which is true to its size variant and few stickers. Minimalistic and useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The overall conference was jam packed with surprises like traditional yakshagana dance, activities which felt like cardio &amp; desk yoga, standup comedy, Bhangra dance which resembled flash mob, timely coffee and great food.</p>

<ol start="6">
<li>
<p>The first speaker was Naman Goel, spoke about &quot;Designing for design: API decisions for long-term success&quot;. Naman is a maintainer at <a href="https://stylexjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StyleX JS</a> at Meta. He spoke about the design decisions, importance of inspiration and lineage in developing libraries and quick demos of stylex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finish your side project to be successful. I do not think this needs any explaination. Simple advice yet profound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>React was inspired by functional programming so hooks were inevitable and a natural progression. The same inspiration is a hidden force in stylex JS as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evolution of ReactJS be like.. React create class --&gt; JSX --&gt; Real classes --&gt; Functional Components --&gt; hooks --&gt; React server components..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conference talk idea. &quot;Algebraic effects&quot;. This is a react concept which is discussed on <a href="https://overreacted.io/algebraic-effects-for-the-rest-of-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan Blog</a> and referenced in Naman Goel speech.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trade offs help us to reach the sweet spot in design decisions. I cant agree more, without tradeoff programming would be simply hard for many.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>React fiber underwent a complete rewrite 8 years ago due to which we are able to add further enhancements to React like hooks, React Server Components (RSC), etc. Its always a good value add to hear directly from maintainers at Meta.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second speaker Nurul Sundarani, spoke about &quot;Beyond the Backend: The Rise of React Server Components&quot;. He gave a lightning introduction to React Server Components (RSC in short) and how we can use them with <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prisma</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the era of RSC, every frontend developer will be a fullstack developer too. Tools like Prisma should help you with that transformation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RSC can directly talk to databases, render only on the server so they can have API keys, good for SEO as the HTML and CSS alone can add value to the web crawlers, make the website quick by avoiding render fetch, etc.. The list goes on. Bottomline learn RSC ASAP. Good for you and your business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third speaker Akash Hamirwasia, spoke about &quot;Enhancing your Static Sites with React Server Components&quot;. Yes, RSC can be used on the static website. Sounds contrary? then read on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://akashhamirwasia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Static websites</a> too run on a server and RSC can make use of the file server to do more. I was not able to find the code on Speaker Github but you need to know that its a possibility to do RSC on static websites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was impressed with ease and confidence with which the relatively young speaker Akash was able to put his point across the room. While I was watching his speech, I was convinced without a doubt. Bottomline, the speaker had exceeding levels of communications skills and confidence. Sometimes you pick up a thing or two non tech skills in a tech conference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fourth speaker Stefinie Fernando spoke about &quot;Building Secure React Apps with Choreo IDevP&quot;. The software Choreo had some similarity with GCP app engine. In choreo the role of the developer ends with commiting code and packaging app into a image. The rest is taken care by Choreo platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Choreo platform boasts of complete software development cycle support ranging from CI/CD to deployment on a cluster. To playaround, visit <a href="https://wso2.com/choreo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Choreo website</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next JS which is a react framework has good levels of RSC support. Other react frameworks like remix are not behind. Think RSC, think react frameworks. RSC have friends too, they are called React server actions. <code>use server</code> directive, heard of it?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>If there were one word that was repeated a lot during react nexus 2024, it would be RSC</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="22">
<li>
<p>The fourth speaker Vamshi Suram spoke about &quot;Scalable mock data injection into Apollo (GraphQL) Client&quot;. Overall the speaker was confortable on stage talking about his open source project <a href="https://github.com/intuit/apollo-mock-http" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apollo-mock-http</a> which helps us with data mocking even in enterprise level applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mocking should be done away from application layer so that they can be toggled with a feature switch. This is not advice specific to apollo client but frontend in general. I like this application design pattern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good mocking should not hinder or interfere with UI rendering because you loose out on the UI interactivity and animation. This advice is given with the context of react components where devs set data to props directly to mock the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fifth speaker Sweta Tanwar spoke about &quot;Defensive Development: Testing Tactics for React Native Resilience&quot;. This was the first speech referencing React Native in React Nexus 2024. The content was actionable and could easily be blown up into a full book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defensive application development can be broken into 3 categories. Code practices, Testing and CI/CD automation. More details in the next thread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code practices include code quality checks, error handling with graceful degradation and error boundaries, component isolation before testing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testing practices include Unit testing with Jest, Integration testing with Enzyme and E2E testing with Detox/Appium. On react we are mostly talking about React testing with Vitest and playwright testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pyramid visualization was used to show that an app needs more unit tests which are efficient and integration testing at the top of the pyramid which are comprehensive. The pyramid slide will be referenced in my future discussions with architects on why unit, e2e and integration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CI/CD automation of tests can be done to catch regression issues in a automated fashion. We can use tools like circle CI, Travis, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Sixth Speaker Rajat Vijay spoke about &quot;Experiments with AI-Generated Tests&quot;. I see the testing theme, pre lunch to be a good idea. Good job organizers. I can sense that Rajat has seen good amount of tests in his career. He clearly outlined the problem with Copilot generated tests and how he intends to fix them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rajat mentioned a tool titled &quot;auto guardian&quot; which instructs AI tools about the expected quality and style of testing. It looks like a config file for AI testing. I feel this would bring uniformity in the AI testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rajat spilled a few interview questions. userEvent vs fireEvent? Whats the difference and which is better. getByRole vs getByText. I will write a blog about these topics soon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rajat referenced <a href="https://www.promptingguide.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.promptingguide.ai/</a> to understand more about writing better prompts. I believe the future auto guardian would refer to these prompting standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The testing demo was fun to watch and clearly the quality of tests can be increased greatly. The link to github repo is broken. Rajat plz toggle the repo to public if its private.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The seventh speaker were from freshworks, spoke about &quot;AI-Assisted Development: Harnessing the Freshworks Freddy Copilot Toolkit for App Development&quot;. The second sponsor speech on day 1. Its interested to see the no code movement gaining steam. Developers can build a full fledged application with a few apps and monetise on the platform. Thats insane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Freedy Copilot had lot of similarities with github copilot. It needed registration, installation on vs code, type your requirement on chat. Freedy can also deploy to their marketplace. Finally no code app generation is in reach / at times free to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The different stages from an idea to app. Requirements gathering, design, implemenation &amp; refactoring, testing can be handled by Freedy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freedy can also build UI for the developers based on the prompt. frontend engineers, gulp it down. Yes AI can build UI. Freedy relies on vision models for generating UI for freshworks marketplace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The engineering behind Freedy copilot was also discussed by second presenter Nagaraj. All I could injest into my mind were LLM, AI and more of it. Finally Day 1 Lunch hour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The post lunch first session featured a panel discussion comprising none other than the react core team from meta, how cool is that. We had Satya talk about the working on React compiler. Yes I heard it for the first time. I know only about React fiber but React compiler is a thing. True to its name, it compiles your react app into something sophisticated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The react compiler could potentially free us from writing useMemo and useCallback as the compiler could do better code optimization compared to a normal developer. However if the compiler identifies a tricky code or hacky code, it will assume that developer is the best judge and shall not mess with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In React 19, ref is a regular prop. I hope to miss forwardExoticComponentRef in my life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was a short and sweet answer to breaking changes, if you had been following the modern standards of react development. Then there are no breaking changes that should bother you. So legacy app developers brace yourself, modern app developers rejoice and upgrade to react 19.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>eslint plugin for react is now updated and optimized for react compiler. However there are many bugs that could escape the eslint and get inferred by React compiler. Code better and do not just trust eslint for react.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>React Strict DOM (RSD) is an integration of React DOM and StyleX, aiming to streamline and standardize the development of styled React components for web and native targets. We had Stylex maintainer Naman Goel talk about the possibilities of RSD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conversation quickly moved towards RSC (React Server Components) best practices. Don&#x27;t waste time hydrating components that are not read/used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Render as you fetch or fetch as you render? An another interview question to note. The panel favoured Render as you fetch as mentioned this is how apps to be built be it RSC or RN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use operator is used for reading resources outside of the render. However it being a panel discussion, no demo or code was shown about the use operator. An another speech topic for potential speakers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The road ahead for react team looks like this. Compilation improvements, eslint plugin updates, lot of tooling related work is expected. I remember panel mentioning NextJS, Remix, etc. The panel discussion felt short but Tapas (the moderator) was well prepared with sharp questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The eighth speaker Prateek Surana spoke about &quot;Elevate your routing game with TanStack Router&quot;. Definitely I felt slightly outdated or an idiot for not use tanstack router after his demo. The power and relevance for enterprise use cases were amazing and would prevent developers from reinventing the wheel around routing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tanstack router is file based, which is easy to understand and relatively hard to scale. To me the most killer feature was auto filter param rename in runtime. Let us say if param was misspelled, tanstack query can correct it for us without breaking the application</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The overall tanstack tools are squarely built around scaled react usecases which is beyond a simple ecommerce use case. I recommend checking out other tanstack tools and I am also excited to see how the tanstack fullstack comes out to be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nineth speaker Palak Bansal spoke about &quot;Mastering Image Optimization Techniques for Web Performance in React Applications&quot;. Let us face it, images can be hard to optimize and Addy osmani has written a book about it. Palak rightly hit the nail on the head by telling &quot;Best practices keep changing which makes image optimization harder&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Broadly there are 3 image optimization techniques that were discussed. They are lazy loading, responsive  images and image CDN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lazy loading can be done on the <img> tag with a attribute called lazy. The responsive images can be based on width of the client or pixel density of the client. Image cdn can be self managed or third party cdn which generate images on the fly specially for the client</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are wondering if the talk around image optimization is not as comprehensive as <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/image-optimization-pre-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Addy Osmani</a> book, you are right. This is a small talk format, some speeches are smaller than others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tenth speaker Jerad Rutnam spoke about &quot;Simplify React App Login&quot;. The reasons for having a login feature are access control and personalization. But having a solid authentication logic can be hard and there were the sponsor of the event pitched his humble React component which was part of <a href="https://wso2.com/asgardeo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asgardeo sdk</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As part of Asgardeo team, the recommendation from Jerad was to delegate complex parts of the app and focus on business logic implementation which could be your goto market strategy. Cannot deny if everyone had good budget, flexibility in the code and restrictions around data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The eleventh speaker Apurv Khare spoke about &quot;Flashpoint Performance&quot;. Is that even a thing or library or concept? Before I could stop wondering, the speaker was sprinting at the speed of flash with his speech. Lots of concepts discussed and I had tough time writing down the ideas from his speech. But the speaker knew his tools and he explained with confidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Measure performance first and optimize later. The speaker took us through different categories of performance metrics like Browser metrics, Core web vitals, Lab data &amp; Field data. The optimization techniques include compression techniques, optimizing JS, optimizing CSS, resource hints and optimized Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speaker idea was to give a crash course on measure performance and also optimizing the performance with some numbers/reports from the tools wherever required. But I do not think the speaker showed us any tool called flashpoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Browser metrics - Time To First Byte (TTFB), Speed Index. Core web vitals / User experience metrics - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Interaction to Next Paint (INP), First Input Delay (FID), Cumulative Latest Shift (CLS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here are some of the tools to measure website performance. App run at lab condition / lab data - Lighthouse, webpage test. App run at field condition / field data - Chrome UX report (CrUX), Pagespeed insights</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The network waterfall was well discussed with webpageTest and web vitals were discussed. The important performance concept, Critical Rendering Path was discussed. Of course, the speaker mentioned how CSSOM is built and how its different from JS DOM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Website performance testing on first load vs repeat load was interesting to me because we generally measure the first load only. Wherever flat text files or documents are served from server to client, we must enable one of the gzip, brottli or other compression techniques</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For optimizing JS - Pause blocking JS, defer it as much as possible. For Optimizing CSS - download CSS ASAP on the device in one chunk so that CSSOM gets built and the user can see the content rendered. Use resource hints like rel, as to pre load the content before it gets used. When prefetching multiple resources, use fetch priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The day 1 post noon, performance speeches continue. The 12th speaker and last speaker of the day was Saurabh Daware and he spoke about &quot;Debugging Performance Issues of Your Website&quot;. The previous speech was theoretical and this speech was practical to the best.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performance issues are like any other bugs, for debugging performance issues just do not put a break point. The first place to look for is the network waterfall whenever we face an issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speaker was running a static site featuring Razorpay landing page, he demonstrated First Contentful Paint and Last Contentful Paint. The speaker attempted to showcase perceived performance optimization and how his attempted interfered with other metrics like LCP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speaker showcased how he cleverly chose to improve the perceived performance by booting the webcontainer only when code gets focus, until that point he shows the static output which gives the user the perception of fast. Its kind of fake it until you make it logic.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="day-2-of-react-nexus-2024">Day 2 of React Nexus 2024<a href="#day-2-of-react-nexus-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 2 of React Nexus 2024" title="Direct link to Day 2 of React Nexus 2024">​</a></h3>
<ol start="72">
<li>
<p>Day 2 felt somewhat slow to me as we did not waste time at registration desk. But things took a turn when we begun the day 2 with a lightening talk about Yoga. The speaker gave a mini talk focussed on breathing, expanding spine length and some posture correction tips. We need to take 10 minutes a day to see the difference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The key exercises mentioned were neck stretches, breathing slow and deep, shoulder roll, cat cow pose while sitting. If you are yoga geek, then Tadasana and Garudasana were mentioned. If you feel stiff like wood, then remember range of motion increases with consistency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 13th speaker Alex Lobera spoke about &quot;Future-proofing state management at scale&quot;. He showcased the app he works on &quot;Miro&quot; and there is definitely lot of user state, sync state happening in the app. The app looks like scrum board and renders on canvas/webGL based on the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The author somehow connected the PHP era with RSC era. We were essentially connecting to DB and building UI all in one php file. We are doing the same in RSC. Just the server was not in the picture during SPA era and now its back. Congrats, everyone is now a full stack engineer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Client can access server state but server cannot access client state. The server is coming back to the picture, this time its different. The server can help us build a state in RSC era. fyi day 2 had lot of speakers flying into India for the conference. Alex was from Portugal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 14th speaker Tapas Adhikary spoke about &quot;Do You Really Need React Query For Your Applications?&quot;. I was one of the user of React Query and I got hooked. The real threat to React Query was change in context due to RSC. Now the client can talk to DB directly. However for complex use cases we might still need tanstack query.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 15th speaker K Kamalakannan spoke about &quot;Simplifying Complex Logic: Leveraging XState in React Development&quot;. I appreciate the state machine part, orchestration and visualization aspect of XState.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 16th speaker Ankit Tailor spoke about &quot;How I built a Powerful Typed System?&quot;. He had worked on a design sytem called gluestack where he has authored CSS in JS which needs to be type safe. I could appreciate the use case for generic data types in designing type systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speaker mentions different aspects of DX like linting, debugging tools, typescript type checks and he showcased a CLI diagnostic tool which could show the size of generated types file which is absolutely needed for performance reasons. npx tsc --diagnostics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 16th and 17th speaker were Mike Grabowski &amp; Eric Vicenti speaking about a new paradigm &quot;How you can Server-Render without Rendering on the Server&quot;. At the core we are trying to use web sockets to communicate with client UI on realtime to render changes. The use case was showcases interactively like a theatre play by 2 speaker on the stage with live coding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speakers showcased their npm component library which could react to our code listening via WS protocol. The links to the code or library cannot be found on google. Watch out for <a href="https://rise.tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rise.tools</a>. Not just the rendering library, rise.tools also has a component library so that developers can quickly build apps along with a playground.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 18th speaker Sanket Sahu spoke about &quot;Building Back-End Driven Universal Apps&quot;. Conceptually Sanket is attempting to solve the same problem as Mike &amp; Eric. Instead of too much code which looks like config. We have syntactically simpler code which can be generated by chatgpt to a very high level of accuracy. Thats in line with no code development of the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 19th speaker Shruti Arya spoke about &quot;Measuring UI performance at scale&quot;. The talk was mostly about React native app on low end android devices. The github project was called component-profiler. Surprisingly I could not catch hold of the link to it. The goal was to prevent long re-renders so that there is no jankiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 20th speaker Santosh Yadav spoke about &quot;Improve your Developer Experience with Nx&quot;. When the pain point that Nx tries to fill was lengthy build times on any machine, be it CI/CD or cloud or local. The NX tool intelligently creates a graph of the code and precisely knows the impact of the code change. Then runs the required build tasks instead of running every single build step on the entire code base.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 21st speaker Apoorv Taneja spoke about &quot;Creating beautiful experiences with Framer-Motion on web&quot;. <a href="https://www.framer.com/motion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Framer motion</a> helps anyone without indepth css knowledge build animations. The speaker precisely showed us how to use framer to create interactivity on the UI components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 22nd speaker Yashpreet Bathla spoke about &quot;Avoid flickering user interfaces&quot;. The presentation deck resembled windows 95 and it was amazing. The speaker explained the concepts like call stack, micro task queue, macro task queue and render queue in detail. He also mentioned the need to maintain 60FPS, and one render in 16.6ms to have a jank free interface. He also showed how using useLayoutEffect helps in preventing jankiness when compared to useEffect</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 23rd speaker Mohit Kumar Toshniwal spoke about &quot;Building XR applications using React Three Fiber&quot;. As speaker rightly said, the AR/VR usage has increased. Be it shopping on amazon or navigating with google maps. We can build AR/VR apps in react with react three fiber, drei, leva, react-xr etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then a panel discussion follows but this time the theme is state of react native. Panelists mentioned that react native is yet to reach v1.0.0. The expo eco system is quite mature and visiting expo.new is the way to get started with React native.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 24th speaker Neha Sharma spoke about &quot;Connecting Worlds: Enhancing Accessibility in React Native TV Applications&quot;. Her talk was more about building accessible react native apps for smart TVs. On the mobile, the accessible is missing unlike accessible semantic html. This calls for more empathy from react native developers. The attributes like accessible are must have to make app accessible on TVs. The speaker reiterated that accessiblity is hard, its not a requirement but a feature to have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 25th speaker Siddharth Kshetrapal spoke about Building accessible reusable react components. Having worked at primer.style, he is proficient in comprehending accessiblity issues and uses his tech speaker skills to make it interesting and understandable to audience. The speaker used 2 commonly used github widgets and tried to make them accessible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Siddharth referenced the importance of <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APG</a> over WCAG in some use cases. he cleverly used the voice over to illustrate the pain, which the disabled people undergo due to our incorrect coding. I was thrilled and hooked to this speech, will certain share this speech to A11 enthusiasts.</p>

<p>I watched the react documentary trailer for the first time and happy to see the people behind React and the collective team spirit. You should watch it too, I mean the full video on youtube titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pDqJVdNa44" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;How A Small Team of Developers Created React at Facebook | React.js: The Documentary&quot;</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sponsors were unintrusive, I was not bored by their presence on the stage or at the booth. Both of them answered the questions earnestly. The Freedy developer, aka AI tool for freshworks marketplace developers booth at the conference was showering goodies to the successful quiz winners and they had a lucky draw too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Asgardio platform which is a simple managed Authentication platform for developers conducted a workshop post the day 1 session which I felt was a generous  offering for attendees. The choreo platform which was an another stall was a useful utility for individual developers and small teams who want to have managed backend service. I love their stickers and pens kept for visitors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The audience were diverse in terms of demographics and their roots. Some of them were from students at Scalar academy, managers at Microsoft, founders of companies and in between. The Javascript community is quite strong like a giant multinational company having its subsidaries for their interests. We have JS Lovers, Chennai React, Delhi React, React Day Bangalore, team shiksha, etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emcee Jobs are hardest and demands Charisma. Aakansha Doshi was simply bold and energetic. The cardio session to beat the sleep was a masterstroke by Aakansha.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From timely humor to manager jokes, the second emcee Sahil Kalyani was equally charismatic on the stage. The third emcee Yashraj Nayak, whom I would remember for &quot;how is the josh&quot; was unique. He had deep connections with speakers and he was able to discuss some enjoyable anecdotes from his experience working with the speaker. Lastly &quot;How is the Josh?&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The one last thing would be the presentation aids prepared by the tech speakers were spellbound. I would appeciate the amount of time, thought and content the speakers have put into the presentations aids / PPT material. I could not differentiate if its online editor or powerpoint tools or excalidraw or just 10x creative powers of the speakers who were frontend engineers.</p>

Treat the below article as an education material only.</p>
<p>On Amazon marketplace, the delivery charges or logistics charges are unavoidable because the amazon products are to be delivered to the customer by Amazon itself.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="amazon-charges-for-the-delivery-directly-and-indirectly">Amazon charges for the delivery directly and indirectly<a href="#amazon-charges-for-the-delivery-directly-and-indirectly" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Amazon charges for the delivery directly and indirectly" title="Direct link to Amazon charges for the delivery directly and indirectly">​</a></h2>
<p>Amazon marketplace makes money from both sides.</p>
<ol>
<li>Money from Customers who buy on Amazon</li>
<li>Money from Sellers who sell on Amazon</li>
</ol>
<p>This is when things turn awry for me. As a seller I pay delivery charges based on multiple factors like location of the seller and how far the location is relative to the seller location. As a seller I have no visibility on if the customer is a prime member or not. Neither any discounts on prime are shown to me. As a seller, I have to factor in the delivery charges in the MRP or collect separate delivery fees. As a amazon prime member if I buy the product, I am already paying for the delivery charge which is factored into the pricing by the seller.</p>
<p>If a non amazon prime member does the purchase below the threshold, then the amazon customer has to pay delivery charges twice because the seller has already factored in, the delivery charges along with the cost price and profit.</p>
<p>But Amazon prime members are not really given any &quot;Free Delivery&quot; as promised, its just a waive off of an platform charge associated with Amazon. The 1499 per year is not a discount voucher for delivery charges. In fact, you might have noticed that some products are less than 50 INR in physical stores like pens but on Amazon they are 150Rs etc because of the delivery charges.</p>
<p>Overall the delivery charges are unavoidable on any ecommerce platform and diminishes the value of the sales if the shopper is not careful. To be careful, the shopper need to be aware of the prices in the real world.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_UI_Q" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Both Amazon Prime and Non Prime members bear the shipping charges directly and indirectly</li>
<li>As a online shopper, think of the value of the shopping transaction before you close the purchase along with myriad other quality and other concerns.</li>
